AgentRelease policySecurity PolicyConceptual guideLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)On this pageLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)\\nPrerequisites\\nRunnable Interface\\n\\nThe LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) takes a declarative approach to building new Runnables from existing Runnables.\\nThis means that you describe what should happen, rather than how it should happen, allowing LangChain to optimize the run-time execution of the chains.\\nWe often refer to a Runnable created using LCEL as a \"chain\". It\\'s important to remember that a \"chain\" is Runnable and it implements the full Runnable Interface.\\nnote\\nThe LCEL cheatsheet shows common patterns that involve the Runnable interface and LCEL expressions.\\nPlease see the following list of how-to guides that cover common tasks with LCEL.\\nA list of built-in Runnables can be found in the LangChain Core API Reference. Many of these Runnables are useful when composing custom \"chains\" in LangChain using LCEL.\\n\\nBenefits of LCEL\\u200b\\nLangChain optimizes the run-time execution of chains built with LCEL in a number of ways:\\n\\nOptimized parallel execution: Run Runnables in parallel using RunnableParallel or run multiple inputs through a given chain in parallel using the Runnable Batch API. Parallel execution can significantly reduce the latency as processing can be done in parallel instead of sequentially.\\nGuaranteed Async support: Any chain built with LCEL can be run asynchronously using the Runnable Async API. This can be useful when running chains in a server environment where you want to handle large number of requests concurrently.\\nSimplify streaming: LCEL chains can be streamed, allowing for incremental output as the chain is executed. LangChain can optimize the streaming of the output to minimize the time-to-first-token(time elapsed until the first chunk of output from a chat model or llm comes out).\\n\\nOther benefits include:\\n\\nSeamless LangSmith tracing\\nAs your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step.\\nWith LCEL, all steps are automatically logged to LangSmith for maximum observability and debuggability.\\nStandard API: Because all chains are built using the Runnable interface, they can be used in the same way as any other Runnable.\\nDeployable with LangServe: Chains built with LCEL can be deployed using for production use.\\n\\nShould I use LCEL?\\u200b\\nLCEL is an orchestration solution -- it allows LangChain to handle run-time execution of chains in an optimized way.\\nWhile we have seen users run chains with hundreds of steps in production, we generally recommend using LCEL for simpler orchestration tasks. When the application requires complex state management, branching, cycles or multiple agents, we recommend that users take advantage of LangGraph.\\nIn LangGraph, users define graphs that specify the application\\'s flow. This allows users to keep using LCEL within individual nodes when LCEL is needed, while making it easy to define complex orchestration logic that is more readable and maintainable.\\nHere are some guidelines:\\n\\nIf you are making a single LLM call, you don\\'t need LCEL; instead call the underlying chat model directly.\\nIf you have a simple chain (e.g., prompt + llm + parser, simple retrieval set up etc.), LCEL is a reasonable fit, if you\\'re taking advantage of the LCEL benefits.\\nIf you\\'re building a complex chain (e.g., with branching, cycles, multiple agents, etc.) use LangGraph instead. Remember that you can always use LCEL within individual nodes in LangGraph.\\n\\nComposition Primitives\\u200b\\nLCEL chains are built by composing existing Runnables together. The two main composition primitives are RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel.\\nMany other composition primitives (e.g., RunnableAssign) can be thought of as variations of these two primitives.\\nnoteYou can find a list of all composition primitives in the LangChain Core API Reference.\\nRunnableSequence\\u200b\\nRunnableSequence is a composition primitive that allows you \"chain\" multiple runnables sequentially, with the output of one runnable serving as the input to the next.\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableSequencechain = RunnableSequence([runnable1, runnable2])API Reference:RunnableSequence\\nInvoking the chain with some input:\\nfinal_output = chain.invoke(some_input)\\ncorresponds to the following:\\noutput1 = runnable1.invoke(some_input)final_output = runnable2.invoke(output1)\\nnoterunnable1 and runnable2 are placeholders for any Runnable that you want to chain together.\\nRunnableParallel\\u200b\\nRunnableParallel is a composition primitive that allows you to run multiple runnables concurrently, with the same input provided to each.\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallelchain = RunnableParallel({    \"key1\": runnable1,    \"key2\": runnable2,})API Reference:RunnableParallel\\nInvoking the chain with some input:\\nfinal_output = chain.invoke(some_input)\\nWill yield a final_output dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary, but with the values replaced by the output of the corresponding runnable.\\n{    \"key1\": runnable1.invoke(some_input),    \"key2\": runnable2.invoke(some_input),}\\nRecall, that the runnables are executed in parallel, so while the result is the same as\\ndictionary comprehension shown above, the execution time is much faster.\\nnoteRunnableParallelsupports both synchronous and asynchronous execution (as all Runnables do).\\nFor synchronous execution, RunnableParallel uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to run the runnables concurrently.\\nFor asynchronous execution, RunnableParallel uses asyncio.gather to run the runnables concurrently.\\n\\nComposition Syntax\\u200b\\nThe usage of RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel is so common that we created a shorthand syntax for using them. This helps\\nto make the code more readable and concise.\\nThe | operator\\u200b\\nWe have overloaded the | operator to create a RunnableSequence from two Runnables.\\nchain = runnable1 | runnable2\\nis Equivalent to:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([runnable1, runnable2])\\nThe .pipe method\\u200b\\nIf you have moral qualms with operator overloading, you can use the .pipe method instead. This is equivalent to the | operator.\\nchain = runnable1.pipe(runnable2)\\nCoercion\\u200b\\nLCEL applies automatic type coercion to make it easier to compose chains.\\nIf you do not understand the type coercion, you can always use the RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel classes directly.\\nThis will make the code more verbose, but it will also make it more explicit.\\nDictionary to RunnableParallel\\u200b\\nInside an LCEL expression, a dictionary is automatically converted to a RunnableParallel.\\nFor example, the following code:\\nmapping = {    \"key1\": runnable1,    \"key2\": runnable2,}chain = mapping | runnable3\\nIt gets automatically converted to the following:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([RunnableParallel(mapping), runnable3])\\ncautionYou have to be careful because the mapping dictionary is not a RunnableParallel object, it is just a dictionary. This means that the following code will raise an AttributeError:mapping.invoke(some_input)\\nFunction to RunnableLambda\\u200b\\nInside an LCEL expression, a function is automatically converted to a RunnableLambda.\\ndef some_func(x):    return xchain = some_func | runnable1\\nIt gets automatically converted to the following:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([RunnableLambda(some_func), runnable1])\\ncautionYou have to be careful because the lambda function is not a RunnableLambda object, it is just a function. This means that the following code will raise an AttributeError:lambda x: x + 1.invoke(some_input)\\nLegacy chains\\u200b\\nLCEL aims to provide consistency around behavior and customization over legacy subclassed chains such as LLMChain and\\nConversationalRetrievalChain. Many of these legacy chains hide important details like prompts, and as a wider variety\\nof viable models emerge, customization has become more and more important.\\nIf you are currently using one of these legacy chains, please see this guide for guidance on how to migrate.\\nFor guides on how to do specific tasks with LCEL, check out the relevant how-to guides.Edit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousKey-value storesNextMessagesBenefits of LCELShould I use LCEL?Composition PrimitivesRunnableSequenceRunnableParallelComposition SyntaxThe | operatorThe .pipe methodCoercionLegacy chainsCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n')]"

There are two main methods an output parser must implement:\\n\\n\"Get format instructions\": A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should be formatted.\\n\"Parse\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.\\n\\nAnd then one optional one:\\n\\n\"Parse with prompt\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and a prompt (assumed to be the prompt that generated such a response) and parses it into some structure. The prompt is largely provided in the event the OutputParser wants to retry or fix the output in some way, and needs information from the prompt to do so.\\n\\nGet started\\u200b\\nBelow we go over the main type of output parser, the PydanticOutputParser.\\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParserfrom langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplatefrom langchain_openai import OpenAIfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field, model_validatormodel = OpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\", temperature=0.0)# Define your desired data structure.class Joke(BaseModel):    setup: str = Field(description=\"question to set up a joke\")    punchline: str = Field(description=\"answer to resolve the joke\")    # You can add custom validation logic easily with Pydantic.    @model_validator(mode=\"before\")    @classmethod    def question_ends_with_question_mark(cls, values: dict) -> dict:        setup = values.get(\"setup\")        if setup and setup[-1] != \"?\":            raise ValueError(\"Badly formed question!\")        return values# Set up a parser + inject instructions into the prompt template.parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=Joke)prompt = PromptTemplate(    template=\"Answer the user query.\\\\n{format_instructions}\\\\n{query}\\\\n\",    input_variables=[\"query\"],    partial_variables={\"format_instructions\": parser.get_format_instructions()},)# And a query intended to prompt a language model to populate the data structure.prompt_and_model = prompt | modeloutput = prompt_and_model.invoke({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"})parser.invoke(output)API Reference:PydanticOutputParser | PromptTemplate | OpenAI\\nJoke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')\\nLCEL\\u200b\\nOutput parsers implement the Runnable interface, the basic building block of the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). This means they support invoke, ainvoke, stream, astream, batch, abatch, astream_log calls.\\nOutput parsers accept a string or BaseMessage as input and can return an arbitrary type.\\nparser.invoke(output)\\nJoke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')\\nInstead of manually invoking the parser, we also could\\'ve just added it to our Runnable sequence:\\nchain = prompt | model | parserchain.invoke({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"})\\nJoke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')\\nWhile all parsers support the streaming interface, only certain parsers can stream through partially parsed objects, since this is highly dependent on the output type. Parsers which cannot construct partial objects will simply yield the fully parsed output.\\nThe SimpleJsonOutputParser for example can stream through partial outputs:\\nfrom langchain.output_parsers.json import SimpleJsonOutputParserjson_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(    \"Return a JSON object with an `answer` key that answers the following question: {question}\")json_parser = SimpleJsonOutputParser()json_chain = json_prompt | model | json_parserAPI Reference:SimpleJsonOutputParser\\nlist(json_chain.stream({\"question\": \"Who invented the microscope?\"}))\\n[{}, {\\'answer\\': \\'\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Ant\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Anton\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Lee\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeu\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwen\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwenho\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwenhoek\\'}]\\nSimilarly,for PydanticOutputParser:\\nlist(chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"}))\\n[Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')]Edit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousHow to run custom functionsNextHow to handle cases where no queries are generatedGet startedLCELCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n')]"

guidesHow to do \"self-querying\" retrievalOn this pageHow to do \"self-querying\" retrieval\\ninfoHead to Integrations for documentation on vector stores with built-in support for self-querying.\\nA self-querying retriever is one that, as the name suggests, has the ability to query itself. Specifically, given any natural language query, the retriever uses a query-constructing LLM chain to write a structured query and then applies that structured query to its underlying vector store. This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documents but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute those filters.\\n\\nGet started\\u200b\\nFor demonstration purposes we\\'ll use a Chroma vector store. We\\'ve created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies.\\nNote: The self-query retriever requires you to have lark package installed.\\n%pip install --upgrade --quiet  lark langchain-chroma\\nfrom langchain_chroma import Chromafrom langchain_core.documents import Documentfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsdocs = [    Document(        page_content=\"A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose\",        metadata={\"year\": 1993, \"rating\": 7.7, \"genre\": \"science fiction\"},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ...\",        metadata={\"year\": 2010, \"director\": \"Christopher Nolan\", \"rating\": 8.2},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea\",        metadata={\"year\": 2006, \"director\": \"Satoshi Kon\", \"rating\": 8.6},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them\",        metadata={\"year\": 2019, \"director\": \"Greta Gerwig\", \"rating\": 8.3},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\",        metadata={\"year\": 1995, \"genre\": \"animated\"},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone\",        metadata={            \"year\": 1979,            \"director\": \"Andrei Tarkovsky\",            \"genre\": \"thriller\",            \"rating\": 9.9,        },    ),]vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())API Reference:Document | OpenAIEmbeddings\\nCreating our self-querying retriever\\u200b\\nNow we can instantiate our retriever.

This chain will take a user query and generated a StructuredQuery object which captures the filters specified by the user. We provide some helper functions for creating a prompt and output parser. These have a number of tunable params that we\\'ll ignore here for simplicity.\\nfrom langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import (    StructuredQueryOutputParser,    get_query_constructor_prompt,)prompt = get_query_constructor_prompt(    document_content_description,    metadata_field_info,)output_parser = StructuredQueryOutputParser.from_components()query_constructor = prompt | llm | output_parserAPI Reference:StructuredQueryOutputParser | get_query_constructor_prompt\\nLet\\'s look at our prompt:\\nprint(prompt.format(query=\"dummy question\"))\\nYour goal is to structure the user\\'s query to match the request schema provided below.<< Structured Request Schema >>When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the following schema:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"query\": string \\\\ text string to compare to document contents    \"filter\": string \\\\ logical condition statement for filtering documents}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical operation statements.A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:- `comp` (eq | ne | gt | gte | lt | lte | contain | like | in | nin): comparator- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to- `val` (string): is the comparison valueA logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:- `op` (and | or | not): logical operator- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation statements): one or more statements to apply the operation toMake sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and no others.Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.Make sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling date data typed values.Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be applied return \"NO_FILTER\" for the filter value.<< Example 1. >>Data Source:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",    \"attributes\": {        \"artist\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"        },        \"length\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"        },        \"genre\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \"pop\", \"rock\" or \"rap\"\"        }    }}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`User Query:What are songs by Taylor Swift or Katy Perry about teenage romance under 3 minutes long in the dance pop genreStructured Request:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"query\": \"teenager love\",    \"filter\": \"and(or(eq(\\\\\"artist\\\\\", \\\\\"Taylor Swift\\\\\"), eq(\\\\\"artist\\\\\", \\\\\"Katy Perry\\\\\")), lt(\\\\\"length\\\\\", 180), eq(\\\\\"genre\\\\\", \\\\\"pop\\\\\"))\"}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`<< Example 2. >>Data Source:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",    \"attributes\": {        \"artist\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"        },        \"length\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"        },        \"genre\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \"pop\", \"rock\" or \"rap\"\"        }    }}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`User Query:What are songs that were not published on SpotifyStructured Request:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"query\": \"\",    \"filter\": \"NO_FILTER\"}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`<< Example 3. >>Data Source:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"content\": \"Brief summary of a movie\",    \"attributes\": {    \"genre\": {        \"description\": \"The genre of the movie.

To make a great retrieval system you\\'ll need to make sure your query constructor works well. Often this requires adjusting the prompt, the examples in the prompt, the attribute descriptions, etc. For an example that walks through refining a query constructor on some hotel inventory data, check out this cookbook.\\nThe next key element is the structured query translator. This is the object responsible for translating the generic StructuredQuery object into a metadata filter in the syntax of the vector store you\\'re using. LangChain comes with a number of built-in translators. To see them all head to the Integrations section.\\nfrom langchain_community.query_constructors.chroma import ChromaTranslatorretriever = SelfQueryRetriever(    query_constructor=query_constructor,    vectorstore=vectorstore,    structured_query_translator=ChromaTranslator(),)API Reference:ChromaTranslator\\nretriever.invoke(    \"What\\'s a movie after 1990 but before 2005 that\\'s all about toys, and preferably is animated\")\\n[Document(page_content=\\'Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\\', metadata={\\'genre\\': \\'animated\\', \\'year\\': 1995})]Edit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousHow to pass runtime secrets to runnablesNextHow to split text based on semantic similarityGet startedCreating our self-querying retrieverTesting it outFilter kConstructing from scratch with LCELCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n')]"

guideLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)On this pageLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)\\nPrerequisites\\nRunnable Interface\\n\\nThe LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) takes a declarative approach to building new Runnables from existing Runnables.\\nThis means that you describe what should happen, rather than how it should happen, allowing LangChain to optimize the run-time execution of the chains.\\nWe often refer to a Runnable created using LCEL as a \"chain\". It\\'s important to remember that a \"chain\" is Runnable and it implements the full Runnable Interface.\\nnote\\nThe LCEL cheatsheet shows common patterns that involve the Runnable interface and LCEL expressions.\\nPlease see the following list of how-to guides that cover common tasks with LCEL.\\nA list of built-in Runnables can be found in the LangChain Core API Reference. Many of these Runnables are useful when composing custom \"chains\" in LangChain using LCEL.\\n\\nBenefits of LCEL\\u200b\\nLangChain optimizes the run-time execution of chains built with LCEL in a number of ways:\\n\\nOptimized parallel execution: Run Runnables in parallel using RunnableParallel or run multiple inputs through a given chain in parallel using the Runnable Batch API. Parallel execution can significantly reduce the latency as processing can be done in parallel instead of sequentially.\\nGuaranteed Async support: Any chain built with LCEL can be run asynchronously using the Runnable Async API. This can be useful when running chains in a server environment where you want to handle large number of requests concurrently.\\nSimplify streaming: LCEL chains can be streamed, allowing for incremental output as the chain is executed. LangChain can optimize the streaming of the output to minimize the time-to-first-token(time elapsed until the first chunk of output from a chat model or llm comes out).\\n\\nOther benefits include:\\n\\nSeamless LangSmith tracing\\nAs your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step.\\nWith LCEL, all steps are automatically logged to LangSmith for maximum observability and debuggability.\\nStandard API: Because all chains are built using the Runnable interface, they can be used in the same way as any other Runnable.\\nDeployable with LangServe: Chains built with LCEL can be deployed using for production use.\\n\\nShould I use LCEL?\\u200b\\nLCEL is an orchestration solution -- it allows LangChain to handle run-time execution of chains in an optimized way.\\nWhile we have seen users run chains with hundreds of steps in production, we generally recommend using LCEL for simpler orchestration tasks. When the application requires complex state management, branching, cycles or multiple agents, we recommend that users take advantage of LangGraph.\\nIn LangGraph, users define graphs that specify the application\\'s flow. This allows users to keep using LCEL within individual nodes when LCEL is needed, while making it easy to define complex orchestration logic that is more readable and maintainable.\\nHere are some guidelines:\\n\\nIf you are making a single LLM call, you don\\'t need LCEL; instead call the underlying chat model directly.\\nIf you have a simple chain (e.g., prompt + llm + parser, simple retrieval set up etc.), LCEL is a reasonable fit, if you\\'re taking advantage of the LCEL benefits.\\nIf you\\'re building a complex chain (e.g., with branching, cycles, multiple agents, etc.) use LangGraph instead. Remember that you can always use LCEL within individual nodes in LangGraph.\\n\\nComposition Primitives\\u200b\\nLCEL chains are built by composing existing Runnables together. The two main composition primitives are RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel.\\nMany other composition primitives (e.g., RunnableAssign) can be thought of as variations of these two primitives.\\nnoteYou can find a list of all composition primitives in the LangChain Core API Reference.\\nRunnableSequence\\u200b\\nRunnableSequence is a composition primitive that allows you \"chain\" multiple runnables sequentially, with the output of one runnable serving as the input to the next.\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableSequencechain = RunnableSequence([runnable1, runnable2])API Reference:RunnableSequence\\nInvoking the chain with some input:\\nfinal_output = chain.invoke(some_input)\\ncorresponds to the following:\\noutput1 = runnable1.invoke(some_input)final_output = runnable2.invoke(output1)\\nnoterunnable1 and runnable2 are placeholders for any Runnable that you want to chain together.\\nRunnableParallel\\u200b\\nRunnableParallel is a composition primitive that allows you to run multiple runnables concurrently, with the same input provided to each.\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallelchain = RunnableParallel({    \"key1\": runnable1,    \"key2\": runnable2,})API Reference:RunnableParallel\\nInvoking the chain with some input:\\nfinal_output = chain.invoke(some_input)\\nWill yield a final_output dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary, but with the values replaced by the output of the corresponding runnable.\\n{    \"key1\": runnable1.invoke(some_input),    \"key2\": runnable2.invoke(some_input),}\\nRecall, that the runnables are executed in parallel, so while the result is the same as\\ndictionary comprehension shown above, the execution time is much faster.\\nnoteRunnableParallelsupports both synchronous and asynchronous execution (as all Runnables do).\\nFor synchronous execution, RunnableParallel uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to run the runnables concurrently.\\nFor asynchronous execution, RunnableParallel uses asyncio.gather to run the runnables concurrently.\\n\\nComposition Syntax\\u200b\\nThe usage of RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel is so common that we created a shorthand syntax for using them. This helps\\nto make the code more readable and concise.\\nThe | operator\\u200b\\nWe have overloaded the | operator to create a RunnableSequence from two Runnables.\\nchain = runnable1 | runnable2\\nis Equivalent to:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([runnable1, runnable2])\\nThe .pipe method\\u200b\\nIf you have moral qualms with operator overloading, you can use the .pipe method instead. This is equivalent to the | operator.\\nchain = runnable1.pipe(runnable2)\\nCoercion\\u200b\\nLCEL applies automatic type coercion to make it easier to compose chains.\\nIf you do not understand the type coercion, you can always use the RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel classes directly.\\nThis will make the code more verbose, but it will also make it more explicit.\\nDictionary to RunnableParallel\\u200b\\nInside an LCEL expression, a dictionary is automatically converted to a RunnableParallel.\\nFor example, the following code:\\nmapping = {    \"key1\": runnable1,    \"key2\": runnable2,}chain = mapping | runnable3\\nIt gets automatically converted to the following:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([RunnableParallel(mapping), runnable3])\\ncautionYou have to be careful because the mapping dictionary is not a RunnableParallel object, it is just a dictionary. This means that the following code will raise an AttributeError:mapping.invoke(some_input)\\nFunction to RunnableLambda\\u200b\\nInside an LCEL expression, a function is automatically converted to a RunnableLambda.\\ndef some_func(x):    return xchain = some_func | runnable1\\nIt gets automatically converted to the following:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([RunnableLambda(some_func), runnable1])\\ncautionYou have to be careful because the lambda function is not a RunnableLambda object, it is just a function. This means that the following code will raise an AttributeError:lambda x: x + 1.invoke(some_input)\\nLegacy chains\\u200b\\nLCEL aims to provide consistency around behavior and customization over legacy subclassed chains such as LLMChain and\\nConversationalRetrievalChain. Many of these legacy chains hide important details like prompts, and as a wider variety\\nof viable models emerge, customization has become more and more important.\\nIf you are currently using one of these legacy chains, please see this guide for guidance on how to migrate.\\nFor guides on how to do specific tasks with LCEL, check out the relevant how-to guides.Edit this pageWas this page

guidesHow to use output parsers to parse an LLM response into structured formatOn this pageHow to use output parsers to parse an LLM response into structured format\\nLanguage models output text. But there are times where you want to get more structured information than just text back. While some model providers support built-in ways to return structured output, not all do.\\nOutput parsers are classes that help structure language model responses. There are two main methods an output parser must implement:\\n\\n\"Get format instructions\": A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should be formatted.\\n\"Parse\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.\\n\\nAnd then one optional one:\\n\\n\"Parse with prompt\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and a prompt (assumed to be the prompt that generated such a response) and parses it into some structure. The prompt is largely provided in the event the OutputParser wants to retry or fix the output in some way, and needs information from the prompt to do so.\\n\\nGet started\\u200b\\nBelow we go over the main type of output parser, the PydanticOutputParser.\\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParserfrom langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplatefrom langchain_openai import OpenAIfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field, model_validatormodel = OpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\", temperature=0.0)# Define your desired data structure.class Joke(BaseModel):    setup: str = Field(description=\"question to set up a joke\")    punchline: str = Field(description=\"answer to resolve the joke\")    # You can add custom validation logic easily with Pydantic.    @model_validator(mode=\"before\")    @classmethod    def question_ends_with_question_mark(cls, values: dict) -> dict:        setup = values.get(\"setup\")        if setup and setup[-1] != \"?\":            raise ValueError(\"Badly formed question!\")        return values# Set up a parser + inject instructions into the prompt template.parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=Joke)prompt = PromptTemplate(    template=\"Answer the user query.\\\\n{format_instructions}\\\\n{query}\\\\n\",    input_variables=[\"query\"],    partial_variables={\"format_instructions\": parser.get_format_instructions()},)# And a query intended to prompt a language model to populate the data structure.prompt_and_model = prompt | modeloutput = prompt_and_model.invoke({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"})parser.invoke(output)API Reference:PydanticOutputParser | PromptTemplate | OpenAI\\nJoke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')\\nLCEL\\u200b\\nOutput parsers implement the Runnable interface, the basic building block of the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). This means they support invoke, ainvoke, stream, astream, batch, abatch, astream_log calls.\\nOutput parsers accept a string or BaseMessage as input and can return an arbitrary type.\\nparser.invoke(output)\\nJoke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')\\nInstead of manually invoking the parser, we also could\\'ve just added it to our Runnable sequence:\\nchain = prompt | model | parserchain.invoke({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"})\\nJoke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')\\nWhile all parsers support the streaming interface, only certain parsers can stream through partially parsed objects, since this is highly dependent on the output type. Parsers which cannot construct partial objects will simply yield the fully parsed output.\\nThe SimpleJsonOutputParser for example can stream through partial outputs:\\nfrom langchain.output_parsers.json import SimpleJsonOutputParserjson_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(    \"Return a JSON object with an `answer` key that answers the following question: {question}\")json_parser = SimpleJsonOutputParser()json_chain = json_prompt | model | json_parserAPI Reference:SimpleJsonOutputParser\\nlist(json_chain.stream({\"question\": \"Who invented the microscope?\"}))\\n[{}, {\\'answer\\': \\'\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Ant\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Anton\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Lee\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeu\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwen\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwenho\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwenhoek\\'}]\\nSimilarly,for PydanticOutputParser:\\nlist(chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"}))\\n[Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')]Edit this pageWas this page

Specifically, given any natural language query, the retriever uses a query-constructing LLM chain to write a structured query and then applies that structured query to its underlying vector store. This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documents but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute those filters.\\n\\nGet started\\u200b\\nFor demonstration purposes we\\'ll use a Chroma vector store. We\\'ve created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies.\\nNote: The self-query retriever requires you to have lark package installed.\\n%pip install --upgrade --quiet  lark langchain-chroma\\nfrom langchain_chroma import Chromafrom langchain_core.documents import Documentfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsdocs = [    Document(        page_content=\"A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose\",        metadata={\"year\": 1993, \"rating\": 7.7, \"genre\": \"science fiction\"},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ...\",        metadata={\"year\": 2010, \"director\": \"Christopher Nolan\", \"rating\": 8.2},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea\",        metadata={\"year\": 2006, \"director\": \"Satoshi Kon\", \"rating\": 8.6},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them\",        metadata={\"year\": 2019, \"director\": \"Greta Gerwig\", \"rating\": 8.3},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\",        metadata={\"year\": 1995, \"genre\": \"animated\"},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone\",        metadata={            \"year\": 1979,            \"director\": \"Andrei Tarkovsky\",            \"genre\": \"thriller\",            \"rating\": 9.9,        },    ),]vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())API Reference:Document | OpenAIEmbeddings\\nCreating our self-querying retriever\\u200b\\nNow we can instantiate our retriever.

This chain will take a user query and generated a StructuredQuery object which captures the filters specified by the user. We provide some helper functions for creating a prompt and output parser. These have a number of tunable params that we\\'ll ignore here for simplicity.\\nfrom langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import (    StructuredQueryOutputParser,    get_query_constructor_prompt,)prompt = get_query_constructor_prompt(    document_content_description,    metadata_field_info,)output_parser = StructuredQueryOutputParser.from_components()query_constructor = prompt | llm | output_parserAPI Reference:StructuredQueryOutputParser | get_query_constructor_prompt\\nLet\\'s look at our prompt:\\nprint(prompt.format(query=\"dummy question\"))\\nYour goal is to structure the user\\'s query to match the request schema provided below.<< Structured Request Schema >>When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the following schema:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"query\": string \\\\ text string to compare to document contents    \"filter\": string \\\\ logical condition statement for filtering documents}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical operation statements.A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:- `comp` (eq | ne | gt | gte | lt | lte | contain | like | in | nin): comparator- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to- `val` (string): is the comparison valueA logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:- `op` (and | or | not): logical operator- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation statements): one or more statements to apply the operation toMake sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and no others.Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.Make sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling date data typed values.Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be applied return \"NO_FILTER\" for the filter value.<< Example 1. >>Data Source:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",    \"attributes\": {        \"artist\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"        },        \"length\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"        },        \"genre\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \"pop\", \"rock\" or \"rap\"\"        }    }}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`User Query:What are songs by Taylor Swift or Katy Perry about teenage romance under 3 minutes long in the dance pop genreStructured Request:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"query\": \"teenager love\",    \"filter\": \"and(or(eq(\\\\\"artist\\\\\", \\\\\"Taylor Swift\\\\\"), eq(\\\\\"artist\\\\\", \\\\\"Katy Perry\\\\\")), lt(\\\\\"length\\\\\", 180), eq(\\\\\"genre\\\\\", \\\\\"pop\\\\\"))\"}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`<< Example 2. >>Data Source:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",    \"attributes\": {        \"artist\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"        },        \"length\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"        },        \"genre\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \"pop\", \"rock\" or \"rap\"\"        }    }}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`User Query:What are songs that were not published on SpotifyStructured Request:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"query\": \"\",    \"filter\": \"NO_FILTER\"}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`<< Example 3. >>Data Source:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"content\": \"Brief summary of a movie\",    \"attributes\": {    \"genre\": {        \"description\": \"The genre of the movie.

To make a great retrieval system you\\'ll need to make sure your query constructor works well. Often this requires adjusting the prompt, the examples in the prompt, the attribute descriptions, etc. For an example that walks through refining a query constructor on some hotel inventory data, check out this cookbook.\\nThe next key element is the structured query translator. This is the object responsible for translating the generic StructuredQuery object into a metadata filter in the syntax of the vector store you\\'re using. LangChain comes with a number of built-in translators. To see them all head to the Integrations section.\\nfrom langchain_community.query_constructors.chroma import ChromaTranslatorretriever = SelfQueryRetriever(    query_constructor=query_constructor,    vectorstore=vectorstore,    structured_query_translator=ChromaTranslator(),)API Reference:ChromaTranslator\\nretriever.invoke(    \"What\\'s a movie after 1990 but before 2005 that\\'s all about toys, and preferably is animated\")\\n[Document(page_content=\\'Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\\', metadata={\\'genre\\': \\'animated\\', \\'year\\': 1995})]Edit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousHow to pass runtime secrets to runnablesNextHow to split text based on semantic similarityGet startedCreating our self-querying retrieverTesting it outFilter kConstructing from scratch with LCELCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n']\n"

guideLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)On this pageLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)\\nPrerequisites\\nRunnable Interface\\n\\nThe LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) takes a declarative approach to building new Runnables from existing Runnables.\\nThis means that you describe what should happen, rather than how it should happen, allowing LangChain to optimize the run-time execution of the chains.\\nWe often refer to a Runnable created using LCEL as a \"chain\". It\\'s important to remember that a \"chain\" is Runnable and it implements the full Runnable Interface.\\nnote\\nThe LCEL cheatsheet shows common patterns that involve the Runnable interface and LCEL expressions.\\nPlease see the following list of how-to guides that cover common tasks with LCEL.\\nA list of built-in Runnables can be found in the LangChain Core API Reference. Many of these Runnables are useful when composing custom \"chains\" in LangChain using LCEL.\\n\\nBenefits of LCEL\\u200b\\nLangChain optimizes the run-time execution of chains built with LCEL in a number of ways:\\n\\nOptimized parallel execution: Run Runnables in parallel using RunnableParallel or run multiple inputs through a given chain in parallel using the Runnable Batch API. Parallel execution can significantly reduce the latency as processing can be done in parallel instead of sequentially.\\nGuaranteed Async support: Any chain built with LCEL can be run asynchronously using the Runnable Async API. This can be useful when running chains in a server environment where you want to handle large number of requests concurrently.\\nSimplify streaming: LCEL chains can be streamed, allowing for incremental output as the chain is executed. LangChain can optimize the streaming of the output to minimize the time-to-first-token(time elapsed until the first chunk of output from a chat model or llm comes out).\\n\\nOther benefits include:\\n\\nSeamless LangSmith tracing\\nAs your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step.\\nWith LCEL, all steps are automatically logged to LangSmith for maximum observability and debuggability.\\nStandard API: Because all chains are built using the Runnable interface, they can be used in the same way as any other Runnable.\\nDeployable with LangServe: Chains built with LCEL can be deployed using for production use.\\n\\nShould I use LCEL?\\u200b\\nLCEL is an orchestration solution -- it allows LangChain to handle run-time execution of chains in an optimized way.\\nWhile we have seen users run chains with hundreds of steps in production, we generally recommend using LCEL for simpler orchestration tasks. When the application requires complex state management, branching, cycles or multiple agents, we recommend that users take advantage of LangGraph.\\nIn LangGraph, users define graphs that specify the application\\'s flow. This allows users to keep using LCEL within individual nodes when LCEL is needed, while making it easy to define complex orchestration logic that is more readable and maintainable.\\nHere are some guidelines:\\n\\nIf you are making a single LLM call, you don\\'t need LCEL; instead call the underlying chat model directly.\\nIf you have a simple chain (e.g., prompt + llm + parser, simple retrieval set up etc.), LCEL is a reasonable fit, if you\\'re taking advantage of the LCEL benefits.\\nIf you\\'re building a complex chain (e.g., with branching, cycles, multiple agents, etc.) use LangGraph instead. Remember that you can always use LCEL within individual nodes in LangGraph.\\n\\nComposition Primitives\\u200b\\nLCEL chains are built by composing existing Runnables together. The two main composition primitives are RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel.\\nMany other composition primitives (e.g., RunnableAssign) can be thought of as variations of these two primitives.\\nnoteYou can find a list of all composition primitives in the LangChain Core API Reference.\\nRunnableSequence\\u200b\\nRunnableSequence is a composition primitive that allows you \"chain\" multiple runnables sequentially, with the output of one runnable serving as the input to the next.\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableSequencechain = RunnableSequence([runnable1, runnable2])API Reference:RunnableSequence\\nInvoking the chain with some input:\\nfinal_output = chain.invoke(some_input)\\ncorresponds to the following:\\noutput1 = runnable1.invoke(some_input)final_output = runnable2.invoke(output1)\\nnoterunnable1 and runnable2 are placeholders for any Runnable that you want to chain together.\\nRunnableParallel\\u200b\\nRunnableParallel is a composition primitive that allows you to run multiple runnables concurrently, with the same input provided to each.\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallelchain = RunnableParallel({    \"key1\": runnable1,    \"key2\": runnable2,})API Reference:RunnableParallel\\nInvoking the chain with some input:\\nfinal_output = chain.invoke(some_input)\\nWill yield a final_output dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary, but with the values replaced by the output of the corresponding runnable.\\n{    \"key1\": runnable1.invoke(some_input),    \"key2\": runnable2.invoke(some_input),}\\nRecall, that the runnables are executed in parallel, so while the result is the same as\\ndictionary comprehension shown above, the execution time is much faster.\\nnoteRunnableParallelsupports both synchronous and asynchronous execution (as all Runnables do).\\nFor synchronous execution, RunnableParallel uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to run the runnables concurrently.\\nFor asynchronous execution, RunnableParallel uses asyncio.gather to run the runnables concurrently.\\n\\nComposition Syntax\\u200b\\nThe usage of RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel is so common that we created a shorthand syntax for using them. This helps\\nto make the code more readable and concise.\\nThe | operator\\u200b\\nWe have overloaded the | operator to create a RunnableSequence from two Runnables.\\nchain = runnable1 | runnable2\\nis Equivalent to:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([runnable1, runnable2])\\nThe .pipe method\\u200b\\nIf you have moral qualms with operator overloading, you can use the .pipe method instead. This is equivalent to the | operator.\\nchain = runnable1.pipe(runnable2)\\nCoercion\\u200b\\nLCEL applies automatic type coercion to make it easier to compose chains.\\nIf you do not understand the type coercion, you can always use the RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel classes directly.\\nThis will make the code more verbose, but it will also make it more explicit.\\nDictionary to RunnableParallel\\u200b\\nInside an LCEL expression, a dictionary is automatically converted to a RunnableParallel.\\nFor example, the following code:\\nmapping = {    \"key1\": runnable1,    \"key2\": runnable2,}chain = mapping | runnable3\\nIt gets automatically converted to the following:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([RunnableParallel(mapping), runnable3])\\ncautionYou have to be careful because the mapping dictionary is not a RunnableParallel object, it is just a dictionary. This means that the following code will raise an AttributeError:mapping.invoke(some_input)\\nFunction to RunnableLambda\\u200b\\nInside an LCEL expression, a function is automatically converted to a RunnableLambda.\\ndef some_func(x):    return xchain = some_func | runnable1\\nIt gets automatically converted to the following:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([RunnableLambda(some_func), runnable1])\\ncautionYou have to be careful because the lambda function is not a RunnableLambda object, it is just a function. This means that the following code will raise an AttributeError:lambda x: x + 1.invoke(some_input)\\nLegacy chains\\u200b\\nLCEL aims to provide consistency around behavior and customization over legacy subclassed chains such as LLMChain and\\nConversationalRetrievalChain. Many of these legacy chains hide important details like prompts, and as a wider variety\\nof viable models emerge, customization has become more and more important.\\nIf you are currently using one of these legacy chains, please see this guide for guidance on how to migrate.\\nFor guides on how to do specific tasks with LCEL, check out the relevant how-to guides.Edit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousKey-value storesNextMessagesBenefits of LCELShould I use LCEL?Composition PrimitivesRunnableSequenceRunnableParallelComposition SyntaxThe | operatorThe .pipe methodCoercionLegacy chainsCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n',\n",

AgentRelease policySecurity PolicyHow-to guidesHow to use output parsers to parse an LLM response into structured formatOn this pageHow to use output parsers to parse an LLM response into structured format\\nLanguage models output text. But there are times where you want to get more structured information than just text back. While some model providers support built-in ways to return structured output, not all do.\\nOutput parsers are classes that help structure language model responses. There are two main methods an output parser must implement:\\n\\n\"Get format instructions\": A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should be formatted.\\n\"Parse\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.\\n\\nAnd then one optional one:\\n\\n\"Parse with prompt\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and a prompt (assumed to be the prompt that generated such a response) and parses it into some structure. The prompt is largely provided in the event the OutputParser wants to retry or fix the output in some way, and needs information from the prompt to do so.\\n\\nGet started\\u200b\\nBelow we go over the main type of output parser, the PydanticOutputParser.\\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParserfrom langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplatefrom langchain_openai import OpenAIfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field, model_validatormodel = OpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\", temperature=0.0)# Define your desired data structure.class Joke(BaseModel):    setup: str = Field(description=\"question to set up a joke\")    punchline: str = Field(description=\"answer to resolve the joke\")    # You can add custom validation logic easily with Pydantic.    @model_validator(mode=\"before\")    @classmethod    def question_ends_with_question_mark(cls, values: dict) -> dict:        setup = values.get(\"setup\")        if setup and setup[-1] != \"?\":            raise ValueError(\"Badly formed question!\")        return values# Set up a parser + inject instructions into the prompt template.parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=Joke)prompt = PromptTemplate(    template=\"Answer the user query.\\\\n{format_instructions}\\\\n{query}\\\\n\",    input_variables=[\"query\"],    partial_variables={\"format_instructions\": parser.get_format_instructions()},)# And a query intended to prompt a language model to populate the data structure.prompt_and_model = prompt | modeloutput = prompt_and_model.invoke({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"})parser.invoke(output)API Reference:PydanticOutputParser | PromptTemplate | OpenAI\\nJoke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')\\nLCEL\\u200b\\nOutput parsers implement the Runnable interface, the basic building block of the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). This means they support invoke, ainvoke, stream, astream, batch, abatch, astream_log calls.\\nOutput parsers accept a string or BaseMessage as input and can return an arbitrary type.\\nparser.invoke(output)\\nJoke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')\\nInstead of manually invoking the parser, we also could\\'ve just added it to our Runnable sequence:\\nchain = prompt | model | parserchain.invoke({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"})\\nJoke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')\\nWhile all parsers support the streaming interface, only certain parsers can stream through partially parsed objects, since this is highly dependent on the output type. Parsers which cannot construct partial objects will simply yield the fully parsed output.\\nThe SimpleJsonOutputParser for example can stream through partial outputs:\\nfrom langchain.output_parsers.json import SimpleJsonOutputParserjson_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(    \"Return a JSON object with an `answer` key that answers the following question: {question}\")json_parser = SimpleJsonOutputParser()json_chain = json_prompt | model | json_parserAPI Reference:SimpleJsonOutputParser\\nlist(json_chain.stream({\"question\": \"Who invented the microscope?\"}))\\n[{}, {\\'answer\\': \\'\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Ant\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Anton\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Lee\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeu\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwen\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwenho\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwenhoek\\'}]\\nSimilarly,for PydanticOutputParser:\\nlist(chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"}))\\n[Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')]Edit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousHow to run custom functionsNextHow to handle cases where no queries are generatedGet startedLCELCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n',\n",

guidesHow to do \"self-querying\" retrievalOn this pageHow to do \"self-querying\" retrieval\\ninfoHead to Integrations for documentation on vector stores with built-in support for self-querying.\\nA self-querying retriever is one that, as the name suggests, has the ability to query itself. Specifically, given any natural language query, the retriever uses a query-constructing LLM chain to write a structured query and then applies that structured query to its underlying vector store. This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documents but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute those filters.\\n\\nGet started\\u200b\\nFor demonstration purposes we\\'ll use a Chroma vector store. We\\'ve created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies.\\nNote: The self-query retriever requires you to have lark package installed.\\n%pip install --upgrade --quiet  lark langchain-chroma\\nfrom langchain_chroma import Chromafrom langchain_core.documents import Documentfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsdocs = [    Document(        page_content=\"A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose\",        metadata={\"year\": 1993, \"rating\": 7.7, \"genre\": \"science fiction\"},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ...\",        metadata={\"year\": 2010, \"director\": \"Christopher Nolan\", \"rating\": 8.2},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea\",        metadata={\"year\": 2006, \"director\": \"Satoshi Kon\", \"rating\": 8.6},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them\",        metadata={\"year\": 2019, \"director\": \"Greta Gerwig\", \"rating\": 8.3},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\",        metadata={\"year\": 1995, \"genre\": \"animated\"},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone\",        metadata={            \"year\": 1979,            \"director\": \"Andrei Tarkovsky\",            \"genre\": \"thriller\",            \"rating\": 9.9,        },    ),]vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())API Reference:Document | OpenAIEmbeddings\\nCreating our self-querying retriever\\u200b\\nNow we can instantiate our retriever.

This chain will take a user query and generated a StructuredQuery object which captures the filters specified by the user. We provide some helper functions for creating a prompt and output parser. These have a number of tunable params that we\\'ll ignore here for simplicity.\\nfrom langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import (    StructuredQueryOutputParser,    get_query_constructor_prompt,)prompt = get_query_constructor_prompt(    document_content_description,    metadata_field_info,)output_parser = StructuredQueryOutputParser.from_components()query_constructor = prompt | llm | output_parserAPI Reference:StructuredQueryOutputParser | get_query_constructor_prompt\\nLet\\'s look at our prompt:\\nprint(prompt.format(query=\"dummy question\"))\\nYour goal is to structure the user\\'s query to match the request schema provided below.<< Structured Request Schema >>When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the following schema:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"query\": string \\\\ text string to compare to document contents    \"filter\": string \\\\ logical condition statement for filtering documents}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical operation statements.A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:- `comp` (eq | ne | gt | gte | lt | lte | contain | like | in | nin): comparator- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to- `val` (string): is the comparison valueA logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:- `op` (and | or | not): logical operator- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation statements): one or more statements to apply the operation toMake sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and no others.Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.Make sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling date data typed values.Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be applied return \"NO_FILTER\" for the filter value.<< Example 1. >>Data Source:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",    \"attributes\": {        \"artist\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"        },        \"length\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"        },        \"genre\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \"pop\", \"rock\" or \"rap\"\"        }    }}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`User Query:What are songs by Taylor Swift or Katy Perry about teenage romance under 3 minutes long in the dance pop genreStructured Request:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"query\": \"teenager love\",    \"filter\": \"and(or(eq(\\\\\"artist\\\\\", \\\\\"Taylor Swift\\\\\"), eq(\\\\\"artist\\\\\", \\\\\"Katy Perry\\\\\")), lt(\\\\\"length\\\\\", 180), eq(\\\\\"genre\\\\\", \\\\\"pop\\\\\"))\"}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`<< Example 2. >>Data Source:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",    \"attributes\": {        \"artist\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"        },        \"length\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"        },        \"genre\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \"pop\", \"rock\" or \"rap\"\"        }    }}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`User Query:What are songs that were not published on SpotifyStructured Request:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"query\": \"\",    \"filter\": \"NO_FILTER\"}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`<< Example 3. >>Data Source:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"content\": \"Brief summary of a movie\",    \"attributes\": {    \"genre\": {        \"description\": \"The genre of the movie.

To make a great retrieval system you\\'ll need to make sure your query constructor works well. Often this requires adjusting the prompt, the examples in the prompt, the attribute descriptions, etc. For an example that walks through refining a query constructor on some hotel inventory data, check out this cookbook.\\nThe next key element is the structured query translator. This is the object responsible for translating the generic StructuredQuery object into a metadata filter in the syntax of the vector store you\\'re using. LangChain comes with a number of built-in translators. To see them all head to the Integrations section.\\nfrom langchain_community.query_constructors.chroma import ChromaTranslatorretriever = SelfQueryRetriever(    query_constructor=query_constructor,    vectorstore=vectorstore,    structured_query_translator=ChromaTranslator(),)API Reference:ChromaTranslator\\nretriever.invoke(    \"What\\'s a movie after 1990 but before 2005 that\\'s all about toys, and preferably is animated\")\\n[Document(page_content=\\'Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\\', metadata={\\'genre\\': \\'animated\\', \\'year\\': 1995})]Edit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousHow to pass runtime secrets to runnablesNextHow to split text based on semantic similarityGet startedCreating our self-querying retrieverTesting it outFilter kConstructing from scratch with LCELCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n']"

Let\\'s break down the key steps and concepts involved:\\n\\n### Key Concepts\\n\\n1. **Query Construction**:\\n   - The query is transformed into a structured form that includes both text content to match against document contents and metadata filters.\\n   - This involves generating a `StructuredQuery` object which contains the textual search term (`query`) and the logical conditions on metadata fields (`filter`).\\n\\n2. **Prompt and Output Parser**:\\n   - A prompt is provided for constructing the structured query, which includes examples of how to format the query.\\n   - An output parser translates the structured query into a form that can be understood by the retrieval system.\\n\\n3. **StructuredQueryTranslator**:\\n   - This component converts the structured query into a filter syntax compatible with the underlying vector store (in this case, Chroma).\\n\\n4. **Self-QueryRetriever**:\\n   - Combines the query constructor and translator to provide an end-to-end solution for constructing and executing self-queries on document collections.\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\\n\\n1. **Define Metadata Fields and Document Content Description**:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import get_query_constructor_prompt, StructuredQueryOutputParser\\n\\n# Define metadata fields and document content description\\nmetadata_field_info = [\\n    {\"name\": \"genre\", \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The genre of the movie. One of [\\'science fiction\\', \\'comedy\\', \\'drama\\', \\'thriller\\', \\'romance\\', \\'action\\', \\'animated\\']\"},\\n    {\"name\": \"year\", \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The year the movie was released\"},\\n    {\"name\": \"director\", \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The name of the movie director\"},\\n    {\"name\": \"rating\", \"type\": \"float\", \"description\": \"A 1-10 rating for the movie\"}\\n]\\n\\ndocument_content_description = \"Brief summary of a movie\"\\n```\\n\\n2. **Generate Query Constructor Prompt and Output Parser**:\\n\\n```python\\nprompt = get_query_constructor_prompt(document_content_description, metadata_field_info)\\noutput_parser = StructuredQueryOutputParser.from_components()\\nquery_constructor = prompt | llm | output_parser\\n```\\n\\n3. **Define the Self-QueryRetriever**:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langchain_community.query_constructors.chroma import ChromaTranslator\\n\\n# Create a self-query retriever\\nretriever = SelfQueryRetriever(\\n    query_constructor=query_constructor,\\n    vectorstore=vectorstore,  # Assume `vectorstore` is already defined and initialized.\\n    structured_query_translator=ChromaTranslator()\\n)\\n```\\n\\n4. **Invoke the Query**:\\n\\n```python\\n# Example queries\\nresponse = retriever.invoke(\"What are some sci-fi movies from the 90\\'s directed by Luc Besson about taxi drivers\")\\nprint(response)\\n\\nresponse = retriever.invoke(\"What\\'s a movie after 1990 but before 2005 that\\'s all about toys, and preferably is animated\")\\nprint(response)\\n```\\n\\n### Advanced Customization\\n\\n- **Adjusting the Prompt**:\\n  - You can customize the prompt by adding or modifying examples to better fit your specific use case.\\n  \\n- **Enabling Limitation**:\\n  - By setting `enable_limit=True` when creating the retriever, you can limit the number of results returned.\\n\\n### Example Output\\n\\n```python\\n# Example output for a query like: \"What are some sci-fi movies from the 90\\'s directed by Luc Besson about taxi drivers\"\\nStructuredQuery(query=\\'taxi driver\\', filter=Operation(operator=<Operator.AND: \\'and\\'>, arguments=[Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: \\'eq\\'>, attribute=\\'genre\\', value=\\'science fiction\\'), Operation(operator=<Operator.AND: \\'and\\'>, arguments=[Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.GTE: \\'gte\\'>, attribute=\\'year\\', value=1990), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.LT: \\'lt\\'>, attribute=\\'year\\', value=2000)]), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: \\'eq\\'>, attribute=\\'director\\', value=\\'Luc Besson\\')]), limit=None)\\n\\n# Example output for a query like: \"What\\'s a movie after 1990 but before 2005 that\\'s all about toys, and preferably is animated\"\\n[Document(page_content=\\'Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\\', metadata={\\'genre\\': \\'animated\\', \\'year\\': 1995})]\\n```\\n\\nThis setup allows you to construct complex queries with both text content and metadata filters, ensuring that the retrieval system can return relevant documents based on user input.'), Document(metadata={'_id': 'f3bd87d374e34000a6fec12649755f0c', '_collection_name': 'raptor'}, page_content='\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to use output parsers to parse an LLM response into structured

guidesHow to use output parsers to parse an LLM response into structured formatOn this pageHow to use output parsers to parse an LLM response into structured format\\nLanguage models output text. But there are times where you want to get more structured information than just text back. While some model providers support built-in ways to return structured output, not all do.\\nOutput parsers are classes that help structure language model responses. There are two main methods an output parser must implement:\\n\\n\"Get format instructions\": A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should be formatted.\\n\"Parse\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.\\n\\nAnd then one optional one:\\n\\n\"Parse with prompt\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and a prompt (assumed to be the prompt that generated such a response) and parses it into some structure. The prompt is largely provided in the event the OutputParser wants to retry or fix the output in some way, and needs information from the prompt to do so.\\n\\nGet started\\u200b\\nBelow we go over the main type of output parser, the PydanticOutputParser.\\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParserfrom langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplatefrom langchain_openai import OpenAIfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field, model_validatormodel = OpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\", temperature=0.0)# Define your desired data structure.class Joke(BaseModel):    setup: str = Field(description=\"question to set up a joke\")    punchline: str = Field(description=\"answer to resolve the joke\")    # You can add custom validation logic easily with Pydantic.    @model_validator(mode=\"before\")    @classmethod    def question_ends_with_question_mark(cls, values: dict) -> dict:        setup = values.get(\"setup\")        if setup and setup[-1] != \"?\":            raise ValueError(\"Badly formed question!\")        return values# Set up a parser + inject instructions into the prompt template.parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=Joke)prompt = PromptTemplate(    template=\"Answer the user query.\\\\n{format_instructions}\\\\n{query}\\\\n\",    input_variables=[\"query\"],    partial_variables={\"format_instructions\": parser.get_format_instructions()},)# And a query intended to prompt a language model to populate the data structure.prompt_and_model = prompt | modeloutput = prompt_and_model.invoke({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"})parser.invoke(output)API Reference:PydanticOutputParser | PromptTemplate | OpenAI\\nJoke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')\\nLCEL\\u200b\\nOutput parsers implement the Runnable interface, the basic building block of the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). This means they support invoke, ainvoke, stream, astream, batch, abatch, astream_log calls.\\nOutput parsers accept a string or BaseMessage as input and can return an arbitrary type.\\nparser.invoke(output)\\nJoke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')\\nInstead of manually invoking the parser, we also could\\'ve just added it to our Runnable sequence:\\nchain = prompt | model | parserchain.invoke({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"})\\nJoke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')\\nWhile all parsers support the streaming interface, only certain parsers can stream through partially parsed objects, since this is highly dependent on the output type. Parsers which cannot construct partial objects will simply yield the fully parsed output.\\nThe SimpleJsonOutputParser for example can stream through partial outputs:\\nfrom langchain.output_parsers.json import SimpleJsonOutputParserjson_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(    \"Return a JSON object with an `answer` key that answers the following question: {question}\")json_parser = SimpleJsonOutputParser()json_chain = json_prompt | model | json_parserAPI Reference:SimpleJsonOutputParser\\nlist(json_chain.stream({\"question\": \"Who invented the microscope?\"}))\\n[{}, {\\'answer\\': \\'\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Ant\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Anton\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Lee\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeu\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwen\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwenho\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwenhoek\\'}]\\nSimilarly,for PydanticOutputParser:\\nlist(chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"}))\\n[Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing\\'), Joke(setup=\\'Why did the tomato turn red?\\', punchline=\\'Because it saw the salad dressing!\\')]Edit this pageWas this page

Integrations for documentation on vector stores with built-in support for self-querying.\\nA self-querying retriever is one that, as the name suggests, has the ability to query itself. Specifically, given any natural language query, the retriever uses a query-constructing LLM chain to write a structured query and then applies that structured query to its underlying vector store. This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documents but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute those filters.\\n\\nGet started\\u200b\\nFor demonstration purposes we\\'ll use a Chroma vector store. We\\'ve created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies.\\nNote: The self-query retriever requires you to have lark package installed.\\n%pip install --upgrade --quiet  lark langchain-chroma\\nfrom langchain_chroma import Chromafrom langchain_core.documents import Documentfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsdocs = [    Document(        page_content=\"A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose\",        metadata={\"year\": 1993, \"rating\": 7.7, \"genre\": \"science fiction\"},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ...\",        metadata={\"year\": 2010, \"director\": \"Christopher Nolan\", \"rating\": 8.2},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea\",        metadata={\"year\": 2006, \"director\": \"Satoshi Kon\", \"rating\": 8.6},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them\",        metadata={\"year\": 2019, \"director\": \"Greta Gerwig\", \"rating\": 8.3},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\",        metadata={\"year\": 1995, \"genre\": \"animated\"},    ),    Document(        page_content=\"Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone\",        metadata={            \"year\": 1979,            \"director\": \"Andrei Tarkovsky\",            \"genre\": \"thriller\",            \"rating\": 9.9,        },    ),]vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())API Reference:Document | OpenAIEmbeddings\\nCreating our self-querying retriever\\u200b\\nNow we can instantiate our retriever.

This chain will take a user query and generated a StructuredQuery object which captures the filters specified by the user. We provide some helper functions for creating a prompt and output parser. These have a number of tunable params that we\\'ll ignore here for simplicity.\\nfrom langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import (    StructuredQueryOutputParser,    get_query_constructor_prompt,)prompt = get_query_constructor_prompt(    document_content_description,    metadata_field_info,)output_parser = StructuredQueryOutputParser.from_components()query_constructor = prompt | llm | output_parserAPI Reference:StructuredQueryOutputParser | get_query_constructor_prompt\\nLet\\'s look at our prompt:\\nprint(prompt.format(query=\"dummy question\"))\\nYour goal is to structure the user\\'s query to match the request schema provided below.<< Structured Request Schema >>When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the following schema:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"query\": string \\\\ text string to compare to document contents    \"filter\": string \\\\ logical condition statement for filtering documents}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical operation statements.A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:- `comp` (eq | ne | gt | gte | lt | lte | contain | like | in | nin): comparator- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to- `val` (string): is the comparison valueA logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:- `op` (and | or | not): logical operator- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation statements): one or more statements to apply the operation toMake sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and no others.Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.Make sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling date data typed values.Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be applied return \"NO_FILTER\" for the filter value.<< Example 1. >>Data Source:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",    \"attributes\": {        \"artist\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"        },        \"length\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"        },        \"genre\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \"pop\", \"rock\" or \"rap\"\"        }    }}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`User Query:What are songs by Taylor Swift or Katy Perry about teenage romance under 3 minutes long in the dance pop genreStructured Request:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"query\": \"teenager love\",    \"filter\": \"and(or(eq(\\\\\"artist\\\\\", \\\\\"Taylor Swift\\\\\"), eq(\\\\\"artist\\\\\", \\\\\"Katy Perry\\\\\")), lt(\\\\\"length\\\\\", 180), eq(\\\\\"genre\\\\\", \\\\\"pop\\\\\"))\"}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`<< Example 2. >>Data Source:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",    \"attributes\": {        \"artist\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"        },        \"length\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"        },        \"genre\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \"pop\", \"rock\" or \"rap\"\"        }    }}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`User Query:What are songs that were not published on SpotifyStructured Request:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"query\": \"\",    \"filter\": \"NO_FILTER\"}\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`<< Example 3. >>Data Source:\\\\`\\\\`\\\\`json{    \"content\": \"Brief summary of a movie\",    \"attributes\": {    \"genre\": {        \"description\": \"The genre of the movie.

To make a great retrieval system you\\'ll need to make sure your query constructor works well. Often this requires adjusting the prompt, the examples in the prompt, the attribute descriptions, etc. For an example that walks through refining a query constructor on some hotel inventory data, check out this cookbook.\\nThe next key element is the structured query translator. This is the object responsible for translating the generic StructuredQuery object into a metadata filter in the syntax of the vector store you\\'re using. LangChain comes with a number of built-in translators. To see them all head to the Integrations section.\\nfrom langchain_community.query_constructors.chroma import ChromaTranslatorretriever = SelfQueryRetriever(    query_constructor=query_constructor,

AgentRelease policySecurity PolicyConceptual guideLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)On this pageLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)\\nPrerequisites\\nRunnable Interface\\n\\nThe LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) takes a declarative approach to building new Runnables from existing Runnables.\\nThis means that you describe what should happen, rather than how it should happen, allowing LangChain to optimize the run-time execution of the chains.\\nWe often refer to a Runnable created using LCEL as a \"chain\". It\\'s important to remember that a \"chain\" is Runnable and it implements the full Runnable Interface.\\nnote\\nThe LCEL cheatsheet shows common patterns that involve the Runnable interface and LCEL expressions.\\nPlease see the following list of how-to guides that cover common tasks with LCEL.\\nA list of built-in Runnables can be found in the LangChain Core API Reference. Many of these Runnables are useful when composing custom \"chains\" in LangChain using LCEL.\\n\\nBenefits of LCEL\\u200b\\nLangChain optimizes the run-time execution of chains built with LCEL in a number of ways:\\n\\nOptimized parallel execution: Run Runnables in parallel using RunnableParallel or run multiple inputs through a given chain in parallel using the Runnable Batch API. Parallel execution can significantly reduce the latency as processing can be done in parallel instead of sequentially.\\nGuaranteed Async support: Any chain built with LCEL can be run asynchronously using the Runnable Async API. This can be useful when running chains in a server environment where you want to handle large number of requests concurrently.\\nSimplify streaming: LCEL chains can be streamed, allowing for incremental output as the chain is executed. LangChain can optimize the streaming of the output to minimize the time-to-first-token(time elapsed until the first chunk of output from a chat model or llm comes out).\\n\\nOther benefits include:\\n\\nSeamless LangSmith tracing\\nAs your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step.\\nWith LCEL, all steps are automatically logged to LangSmith for maximum observability and debuggability.\\nStandard API: Because all chains are built using the Runnable interface, they can be used in the same way as any other Runnable.\\nDeployable with LangServe: Chains built with LCEL can be deployed using for production use.\\n\\nShould I use LCEL?\\u200b\\nLCEL is an orchestration solution -- it allows LangChain to handle run-time execution of chains in an optimized way.\\nWhile we have seen users run chains with hundreds of steps in production, we generally recommend using LCEL for simpler orchestration tasks. When the application requires complex state management, branching, cycles or multiple agents, we recommend that users take advantage of LangGraph.\\nIn LangGraph, users define graphs that specify the application\\'s flow. This allows users to keep using LCEL within individual nodes when LCEL is needed, while making it easy to define complex orchestration logic that is more readable and maintainable.\\nHere are some guidelines:\\n\\nIf you are making a single LLM call, you don\\'t need LCEL; instead call the underlying chat model directly.\\nIf you have a simple chain (e.g., prompt + llm + parser, simple retrieval set up etc.), LCEL is a reasonable fit, if you\\'re taking advantage of the LCEL benefits.\\nIf you\\'re building a complex chain (e.g., with branching, cycles, multiple agents, etc.) use LangGraph instead. Remember that you can always use LCEL within individual nodes in LangGraph.\\n\\nComposition Primitives\\u200b\\nLCEL chains are built by composing existing Runnables together. The two main composition primitives are RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel.\\nMany other composition primitives (e.g., RunnableAssign) can be thought of as variations of these two primitives.\\nnoteYou can find a list of all composition primitives in the LangChain Core API Reference.\\nRunnableSequence\\u200b\\nRunnableSequence is a composition primitive that allows you \"chain\" multiple runnables sequentially, with the output of one runnable serving as the input to the next.\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableSequencechain = RunnableSequence([runnable1, runnable2])API Reference:RunnableSequence\\nInvoking the chain with some input:\\nfinal_output = chain.invoke(some_input)\\ncorresponds to the following:\\noutput1 = runnable1.invoke(some_input)final_output = runnable2.invoke(output1)\\nnoterunnable1 and runnable2 are placeholders for any Runnable that you want to chain together.\\nRunnableParallel\\u200b\\nRunnableParallel is a composition primitive that allows you to run multiple runnables concurrently, with the same input provided to each.\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallelchain = RunnableParallel({    \"key1\": runnable1,    \"key2\": runnable2,})API Reference:RunnableParallel\\nInvoking the chain with some input:\\nfinal_output = chain.invoke(some_input)\\nWill yield a final_output dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary, but with the values replaced by the output of the corresponding runnable.\\n{    \"key1\": runnable1.invoke(some_input),    \"key2\": runnable2.invoke(some_input),}\\nRecall, that the runnables are executed in parallel, so while the result is the same as\\ndictionary comprehension shown above, the execution time is much faster.\\nnoteRunnableParallelsupports both synchronous and asynchronous execution (as all Runnables do).\\nFor synchronous execution, RunnableParallel uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to run the runnables concurrently.\\nFor asynchronous execution, RunnableParallel uses asyncio.gather to run the runnables concurrently.\\n\\nComposition Syntax\\u200b\\nThe usage of RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel is so common that we created a shorthand syntax for using them. This helps\\nto make the code more readable and concise.\\nThe | operator\\u200b\\nWe have overloaded the | operator to create a RunnableSequence from two Runnables.\\nchain = runnable1 | runnable2\\nis Equivalent to:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([runnable1, runnable2])\\nThe .pipe method\\u200b\\nIf you have moral qualms with operator overloading, you can use the .pipe method instead. This is equivalent to the | operator.\\nchain = runnable1.pipe(runnable2)\\nCoercion\\u200b\\nLCEL applies automatic type coercion to make it easier to compose chains.\\nIf you do not understand the type coercion, you can always use the RunnableSequence and RunnableParallel classes directly.\\nThis will make the code more verbose, but it will also make it more explicit.\\nDictionary to RunnableParallel\\u200b\\nInside an LCEL expression, a dictionary is automatically converted to a RunnableParallel.\\nFor example, the following code:\\nmapping = {    \"key1\": runnable1,    \"key2\": runnable2,}chain = mapping | runnable3\\nIt gets automatically converted to the following:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([RunnableParallel(mapping), runnable3])\\ncautionYou have to be careful because the mapping dictionary is not a RunnableParallel object, it is just a dictionary. This means that the following code will raise an AttributeError:mapping.invoke(some_input)\\nFunction to RunnableLambda\\u200b\\nInside an LCEL expression, a function is automatically converted to a RunnableLambda.\\ndef some_func(x):    return xchain = some_func | runnable1\\nIt gets automatically converted to the following:\\nchain = RunnableSequence([RunnableLambda(some_func), runnable1])\\ncautionYou have to be careful because the lambda function is not a RunnableLambda object, it is just a function. This means that the following code will raise an AttributeError:lambda x: x + 1.invoke(some_input)\\nLegacy chains\\u200b\\nLCEL aims to provide consistency around behavior and customization over legacy subclassed chains such as LLMChain and\\nConversationalRetrievalChain. Many of these legacy chains hide important details like prompts, and as a wider variety\\nof viable models emerge, customization has become more and more important.\\nIf you are currently using one of these legacy chains, please see this guide for guidance on how to migrate.\\nFor guides on how to do specific tasks with LCEL, check out the relevant how-to guides.Edit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousKey-value storesNextMessagesBenefits of LCELShould I use LCEL?Composition PrimitivesRunnableSequenceRunnableParallelComposition SyntaxThe | operatorThe .pipe methodCoercionLegacy chainsCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n')]\n"

The guide suggests migrating these to LCEL for better type coercion, explicitness, and ease of use.\\n\\n### Example Use Case\\n\\nSuppose you want to create a chain that processes some input through three steps: transformation, retrieval, and parsing:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableSequence\\n\\n# Define individual runnables\\ntransformation = RunnableLambda(lambda x: f\"Transformed {x}\")\\nretrieval = RunnableParallel({\"key1\": lambda x: f\"Retrieved 1 for {x}\", \"key2\": lambda x: f\"Retrieved 2 for {x}\"})\\nparsing = RunnableSequence([RunnableLambda(lambda x: f\"Parsed {x}\")])\\n\\n# Create the chain\\nchain = transformation | retrieval | parsing\\n\\ninput_data = \"example input\"\\n\\noutput = chain.invoke(input_data)\\nprint(output)  # Output will be a dictionary with transformed and parsed data from each step.\\n```\\n\\nThis example demonstrates how to use LCEL to build complex chains from simpler runnables, ensuring optimized execution and maintainability.\\n\\nIf you need more specific help or examples related to your exact scenario, feel free to provide additional details!'"
