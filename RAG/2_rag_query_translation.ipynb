    "### In this article, I will introduce advanced techniques of RAG: Query Translation.\n",
    "More specifically, we will learn three Query Translation methods: Re-written, Step-back question, and sub-question, to enhance retrieval and generation effectiveness. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Re-written\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-written involves semantically rewriting the original query, maintaining the core meaning while adjusting the language expression to facilitate handling by knowledge bases or retrieval systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will rewrite the original question into three different forms: Q1, Q2, and Q3, and then retrieve documents relevant to each of these three formulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "The original question is linguistically vague or unclearly expressed.\n",
    "Optimization of retrieval matching through different formulations.\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Original question: \"What is the capital of France?\" \n",
    "#### Re-written: \"What is the capital of France?\" \n",
    "#### Effect: The rewritten question is more specific, making it easier to retrieve high-quality answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-Query: Generating multiple different queries for the same question during retrieval to access a more comprehensive or relevant set of documents.\n",
    "#### RAG Fusion: A strategy to fuse retrieval results during generation. It focuses on integrating information from multiple retrieved documents to generate high-quality answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enhances the retrieval system's understanding of questions.\n",
    "#### Improves the relevance of retrieval results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining semantic consistency between the rewritten question and the original question.\n",
    "Avoiding introducing bias or ambiguity."

It characterizes regional economic conditions and pros-pects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District’ssources. Reports are published eight times per year.What is the purpose of the Beige Book?The Beige Book is intended to characterize the change in economic conditions since the lastreport. Outreach for the Beige Book is one of many ways the Federal Reserve System engageswith businesses and other organizations about economic developments in their communities.Because this information is collected from a wide range of contacts through a variety of formaland informal methods, the Beige Book can complement other forms of regional information gath-ering. The Beige Book is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.How is the information collected?Each Federal Reserve Bank gathers information on current economic conditions in its Districtthrough reports from Bank and Branch directors, plus interviews and online questionnaires com-pleted by businesses, community organizations, economists, market experts, and other sources.Contacts are not selected at random; rather, Banks strive to curate a diverse set of sources thatcan provide accurate and objective information about a broad range of economic activities. TheBeige Book serves as a regular summary of this information for the public.How is the information used?The information from contacts supplements the data and analysis used by Federal Reserve econo-mists and staff to assess economic conditions in the Federal Reserve Districts. The qualitativenature of the Beige Book creates an opportunity to characterize dynamics and identify emergingtrends in the economy that may not be readily apparent in the available economic data. This infor-Note: The Federal Reserve officially identifies Districts by number and Reserve Bank city. In the 12th District, the SeattleBranch serves Alaska, and the San Francisco Bank serves Hawaii. The System serves commonwealths and territories asfollows: the New York Bank serves the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; the San Francisco Bankserves American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The Board of Governors revisedthe branch boundaries of the System in February 1996.\\nii'),\n",

A list of statistical releases compiled by the Federal ReserveBoard is available here, links to each of the Federal Reserve Banks are available here, and a sum-mary of the System’s community outreach is available here. In addition, Fed Listens events havebeen held around the country to hear about how monetary policy affects peoples’ daily lives andlivelihoods. The System also relies on a variety of advisory councils—whose members are drawnfrom a wide array of businesses, non-profit organizations, and community groups—to hear diverseperspectives on the economy in carrying out its responsibilities.\\niiiThe Beige Book'),\n",

Consumer spending moved up moderately, with most Districtsreporting strong holiday sales that exceeded expectations. Vehicle sales grew modestly. Construc-tion activity decreased overall, with several Districts indicating that high costs for materials andfinancing were weighing on growth. Manufacturing decreased slightly on net, and a number of Dis-tricts said manufacturers were stockpiling inventories in anticipation of higher tariffs. Residentialreal estate activity was unchanged on balance, as high mortgage rates continued to hold backdemand. Commercial real estate sales edged up. The nonfinancial services sector grew slightlyoverall, with Districts highlighting growth in leisure and hospitality and transportation, notably airtravel. Truck freight volumes, however, were down. Financial service providers reported modestgrowth in lending and little change in asset quality overall, though lenders and community organi-zations voiced concerns about delinquencies among small businesses and lower-income house-holds. Nonprofit social service agencies faced high demand amidst uncertainty about futurefunding levels. Agricultural conditions remained weak overall, with generally lower farm incomesand weather-related struggles in some areas. The spread of avian flu reduced egg supplies andpushed up prices. Energy activity was mixed. More contacts were optimistic about the outlook for2025 than were pessimistic about it, though contacts in several Districts expressed concerns thatchanges in immigration and tariff policy could negatively affect the economy.Labor MarketsEmployment ticked up on balance, with six Districts reporting a slight increase and six reportingno change. Contacts in several service industries, notably healthcare, continued to see jobgrowth. Construction employment increased slightly, while manufacturing employment was flat.Contacts across multiple sectors noted difficulty finding skilled workers, and reports of layoffsremained rare. However, contacts in some Districts expressed greater uncertainty about theirfuture staffing needs. Wage growth picked up to a moderate pace in most Districts, though therewere some reports that wage pressures had eased.Note: This report was prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago based on information collected on or beforeJanuary 6, 2025, and thus, before the wildfires in the Greater Los Angeles area started.

Contacts did not foresee major changes in pricingpressures for their businesses moving forward.Retail and TourismFirst District retail contacts reported slight increases in revenues in recent months, while tourismactivity experienced modest growth on average. An online retailer described fourth-quarter rev-enues as stable overall but said that promotions had been critical to those results and thatdemand for lower-end goods remained weak. On Cape Cod in the fourth quarter, hotel occupancyrates and retail sales met expectations and were roughly on par with the fourth quarter of 2023,but restaurants experienced weaker-than-expected sales. Airline passenger traffic through Bostonincreased moderately in the fourth quarter from one year earlier, with domestic travel finally sur-passing 2019 levels. Worcester air passenger counts grew 18 percent from the previous year. Likethe change in hotel room prices, hotel occupancy rates in greater Boston were down slightly inNovember from one year earlier, when occupancy rates had been at all-time highs. Contactsexpected robust tourism and convention activity for Boston for 2025. The outlook for retail andrestaurant activity was more cautious, as contacts in those businesses expected roughly flatactivity going forward.Manufacturing and Related ServicesManufacturing sales were flat on average since the last report. Most firms reported no change inrevenues in the fourth quarter from the third, but sales were unexpectedly soft for one manufac-turer and unexpectedly strong for another. The strong sales pertained to a frozen fish producerwho speculated that retailers were accumulating inventories in anticipation of tariffs. A semi-conductor maker with flat sales said that demand for their products was softening and that theywould adjust employment downward moving forward. Capital expenditures largely stayed withinforecast ranges. The outlook for 2025 was modestly positive on balance, as most firms expectedsales to increase at least slightly in the new year, but one semiconductor manufacturer expectedmoderate declines in sales relative to 2024.IT and Software ServicesFirst District IT and software services contacts described demand as stable at healthy levels, andone firm’s total revenues for 2024 exceeded expectations.

Contacts expected revenues to increase strongly in the first quarter of 2025, based on acombination of organic growth in demand and, in one case, the recent acquisition of another com-pany. Considering the longer-term outlook, most contacts expressed confidence that demand fortheir products would continue to rise, even in an environment of heightened political and macro-economic uncertainty. Nonetheless, one firm said that increased competition from China affectingits clients could either boost its business, as client firms invested in new technologies to keep up,or hurt demand if clients were pushed out of the market altogether by such competition.Commercial Real EstateCommercial real estate activity was mostly flat in the First District. Contacts reported uniformlythat elevated long-term interest rates continued to limit transactions. One contact said that bor-rowers, hoping that long-term rates would decline, continued to favor extensions for maturingloans. However, several contacts downgraded the chances of significant rate declines in 2025.Office leasing activity remained slow, but prime Boston properties continued to experience rela-tively healthy activity. Contacts described industrial and retail leasing activity as stable. Rents andoccupancy rates were unchanged across all asset classes. One contact said that a recent Massa-chusetts law intended to promote multifamily construction was yielding tangible results in someareas of the state.

Supporting the increase in sales, home invento-ries were up moderately from a year ago overall, with very large increases in Maine and Vermont,although inventories declined moderately in Massachusetts from a year earlier. However, thetypical number of days homes spent on the market increased, as multiple contacts mentionedthat some buyers were waiting until after the presidential election to make purchasing decisions.Considering changes since November 2023, prices of single-family homes increased at a briskpace, while condo prices increased moderately on average in Massachusetts and Rhode Islandbut decreased modestly in the northern New England states. Multiple contacts expressed opti-mism that more sellers would put their homes on the market in early 2025 and that this wouldlead to increased sales activity.

There was some softness in quickservice restaurants, as ticket sizes shrank, or customers opted for value meals, while middle- andhigher-end restaurants saw solid demand. Auto sales were strong, with inventories and days onthe lot declining.Travel and tourism activity increased at a moderate pace in recent weeks. Many industry contactsreported stronger holiday travel than last year. Some hotels noted room rates were down slightly,but many reported strong bookings and increased revenue. Cruising activity, as well as businessand group travel, remained strong.Construction and Real EstateIn spite of elevated mortgage interest rates and home prices, housing sales increased modestlyover the reporting period. With some exceptions, existing home supply improved significantlythroughout the District. Homebuilders continued to offer incentives and discounts to offset highermortgage interest rates. Builders also slowed the pace of speculative inventory starts to allowexisting inventory to be absorbed, in an effort to prevent an inventory buildup of new homes.Commercial real estate (CRE) conditions remained mixed. With the aid of concessions, multifamilydemand continued to increase, however, already elevated vacancy rates rose further. Contactsreported growing concern in a stable but slowing industrial sector. Non-bank lenders noted greateramounts of CRE loan delinquencies. The number of banks returning to the CRE lending marketrose, but rising long-term rates and CRE loan maturities continued to create challenges for alllender types.TransportationTransportation activity grew slightly, on balance, since the previous report. Short-line railroad vol-umes were described as flat; however, Class I railroads saw solid increases in intermodal freightand total traffic. Some logistics contacts noted relatively stable volumes and flat revenues.

Inland waterway freight activity picked up. District ports reported con-tinued increases in container volumes and roll-on/roll-off cargo. However, the potential for an eastcoast port strike remains a downside risk. Transportation contacts noted uncertainty over futuretrade policy, the regulatory environment, and insurance costs.ManufacturingWith some exceptions, overall manufacturing activity continued to decline modestly. According tothe Atlanta Fed’s Business Inflation Expectations Manufacturing Sector Report, more than two-thirds of respondents stated that demand remained the same or had declined over the pasttwelve months. Firms facing lower demand reported adjusting by eliminating open positions and/orlaying off staff and reducing hours. Firms with improved demand increased capacity, prices, andcapital investments. Risks to the outlook included labor shortages, concerns over tariffs, andpotential supply chain disruptions at east coast ports that would result from a labor strike.Banking and FinanceSixth District financial institutions experienced moderate loan growth, driven by increases in multi-family loans and first-lien mortgages. Construction, land development loans, and auto loans con-tracted modestly; all other major loan categories increased moderately. Asset quality remainedstable with low levels of nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans. Both deposit bal-ances and borrowings by banks increased, as loan-to-deposit ratios fell amid rising loan growth.Cash balances grew, outpacing asset growth.EnergyEnergy activity grew modestly, on net, over the reporting period. Rising demand was largely drivenby data center growth across the U.S. Utility contacts noted that near-term demand will be metwith a combination of natural gas, renewables, battery energy storage systems, and potentiallykeeping coal plants running longer than anticipated. Global demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG)remained strong, thus regional exporters operated near capacity and contacts described renewedinterest in LNG export plant development.

Retailers indicated that promotional offerings were similar tolast year and that full-price sales were greater than expected. Leisure and hospitality spendingticked up, boosted by greater demand for air travel and at fast casual restaurants. Both new andused light vehicle sales rose slightly, as did leasing activity. Subcompact and compact vehiclescontinued to gain market share, though at a slower pace as excess inventories of mid- and full-size vehicles led to larger incentives on these alternatives.

There were few mentions of materials shortages, though several contacts again notedlong lead times for power supply equipment.Construction and Real EstateConstruction and real estate demand was unchanged over the reporting period. Residential con-struction was stable and demand for home renovation projects remained soft. The size of renova-tion projects continued to shrink. Residential real estate activity decreased slightly, held back bythe recent rise in mortgage rates and ongoing tight inventory levels. Prices were unchanged, whilerents increased slightly.

Compared with an average year, income was about average for agricultureoperations overall, but low for crop farmers. Contacts expected a further decline in income in2025, with overall input costs expected to be roughly unchanged and product prices expected tobe flat or down. Prices for corn, cattle, and cheese increased over the reporting period, whileprices for soybeans, wheat, and dairy were flat. Hog prices declined. Egg prices jumped along withflock liquidations due to avian influenza, and there were concerns about avian flu spreadingbeyond the poultry sector. Slow farm equipment sales led manufacturers to offers of interest-freepayment plans to entice borrowers. Contacts expected that smaller margins in 2024 and 2025would require many farmers to borrow more; they also indicated that many loans made three tofive years ago will soon reprice to higher interest rates. The farm sector will receive additional pay-ments from the federal government to help cover disaster losses and lower product prices.Community ConditionsCommunity, nonprofit, and small business contacts saw little change in economic conditions overthe reporting period. Contacts were less likely to mention inflation than in prior periods, and morelikely to mention softening in the labor market. State government officials saw mixed growth in taxrevenues. Concerns around the lack of supply of affordable housing remained top of mind for com-munity contacts, especially in the District’s smaller markets, with some observing increases inhomelessness and “couch-hopping.” While nonprofit contacts reported healthy year-end donations,they also noted significant increases in operating costs, especially for insurance, and persistenthigh demand for their services.

Overall leisure and hospitality spending continued to rise, albeit with somesigns of a softer outlook ahead. Casino operators in New Mexico reported fewer visits and lowerspending per visit, and contacts at Oklahoma casinos indicated the outlook for 2025 is lower thanthe previous two years. Ski resort contacts noted busy early-season bookings and a sold-outholiday season. However, out-of-state powder hounds opted for lower cost basic passes to save ontheir ski vacations and locals were reportedly less likely to book lodging in advance, gambling thatlower prices on vacant lodging would be available. While durable consumption contracted over thepast month, auto purchases grew moderately driven by pent-up demand as many consumers madeyear-end vehicle purchases. Consumers reportedly took on long-term financing (often more than72 months) to reduce monthly auto payments in an effort to manage household budgetconstraints.Community ConditionsContacts reported low- and moderate-income (LMI) consumers were struggling with increasing debtburdens. Most contacts said that they were seeing higher credit card utilization, increasing debt-to-income ratios, and delinquencies. Community development financial institutions contacts notedmore clients were seeking consolidation loans due to higher debt burdens. Contacts indicated LMIpopulations continued to struggle with food and housing prices, as the ability to offset prices waslimited due to higher earnings pushing households toward a benefits cliff with a potential loss ingovernment benefits. One contact noted workers would need at least a 10 to 15 percent increasein wages to offset lost benefits but were only finding jobs with much smaller increases.Manufacturing and Other Business ActivityActivity in service sectors grew moderately over the past month, largely driven by consumer-facingservices rather than business services. Contacts shared that households within the region hadsome pent-up demand for purchases that were delayed due to economic concerns that subsidedrecently.

Municipal construction projects hadbeen a key source of demand in recent years, but municipal development activity is waning as theavailability of public funds and outlook for fiscal spending dwindle. Contacts indicated more privatesector customers are coming to the table to satisfy pent-up demand from delayed developmentprojects and deferred maintenance, offsetting the declines in municipal projects.

Overall expectations for construction activity were favorable for the next six months, withcontacts indicating an outlook for modest growth.Community and Regional BankingLoan demand and credit standards were mostly unchanged across categories. However, the trendof lower demand for residential mortgage loans continued. Concerns related to credit performanceover the next six months were less prevalent overall but shifted notably to different segments ofthe regional economy. Much of the improvement in the outlook around credit performance was dueto concerns with commercial real estate loans being modified in the lower interest rate environ-ment. In contrast, contacts reported more pessimism for agriculture loans, as grain pricesremained low. Deposit levels were stable, though bankers noted a continued migration into certifi-cate of deposit accounts and money market accounts, as customers took advantage of the cur-rent rate environment.EnergyTenth District oil and gas activity fell modestly. While most contacts reported no change in activity,approximately a quarter of businesses reported declines. The number of active oil rigs in the Dis-trict fell slightly, while gas rig counts rose as natural gas prices now meet the average breakevenprice reported by firms.

Growthresumed in manufacturing output and activity picked up in nonfinancial services and retail. Bankloan volume expanded, and banks reported increased demand for loans despite continued credittightening. Home sales increased slightly, while energy activity was steady. Overall employmentrose slightly in December, although manufacturing employment was flat. Wages and prices grewmoderately. Demand for nonprofit services remained high amid uncertainty regarding governmentfunding. Outlooks continued to improve although there was concern regarding potentially adverseeffects of future immigration and trade policies.Labor MarketsEmployment rose slightly in December. Services employment increased led by education andhealth services, while employment fell in trade, transportation, and utilities and information ser-vices. Manufacturing employment remained flat as job gains in durable goods were offset bylosses in nondurable goods manufacturing. According to a Dallas Fed survey, about a third of firmsare looking to hire either for new positions or replacement, while around two percent are laying offworkers, both percentages remained steady since August.Contacts reported an adequate supply of low-skilled labor, but a tight supply of skilled workers.One firm is looking to hire remote workers abroad to meet its need for skilled workers and anotherfirm noted increasing wages to retain talent. A third contact noted that their firm’s growth is beingheld back by the struggle to find high-quality employees. Energy contacts stated that while overallhiring was on pause, exceptions were being made for certain skilled positions. Wage growthremained moderate, but firms anticipate wage growth to be slower in the upcoming year than itwas in the past 12 months.PricesPrices increased at a moderate pace over the reporting period. Selling and input prices grew mod-erately in services, while slowing to a modest pace in manufacturing. Contacts broadly noted thatpotential tariffs would raise input costs, and, in response, several firms anticipate passing\\n41'),\n",

Firms plan to raise selling prices by more than they didin 2024 although input prices are expected to grow more slowly.ManufacturingManufacturing activity grew modestly in December, led by gains in computer and electronic productand food manufacturing. Manufacturers reported no growth in new orders, though many expect anincrease in demand in the first half of 2025. A Dallas Fed survey showed that two-thirds of manu-facturers are acting ahead of the anticipated tariffs, by raising prices, finding new suppliers, and inhousing production or processes. Outlooks continued to improve in December but were temperedby concern about changes in domestic policy.Retail SalesRetail sales grew robustly in December driven by increased revenues for retailers and nondurablegoods wholesalers. Meanwhile, durable goods wholesalers saw net declines. Auto dealersreported a modest increase in sales, although a few contacts noted that margins continue toremain under pressure. Overall outlooks remained positive with some contacts citing optimismabout the implementation of business-friendly policies by the incoming administration.Nonfinancial ServicesNonfinancial services activity continued to grow moderately over the reporting period. Revenuegrowth was led by trade, transportation, and utilities as well as professional and business ser-vices. Revenues fell in information and leisure and hospitality. A transportation services firmreported a small increase in parcel volumes, while another contact noted that despite slowgrowth, overall parcel volumes in 2024 will match the 2022 record-breaking level. Demand for airtravel remained strong driven by leisure travel. Despite this, one airline industry contact reportednot planning to increase capacity to keep upward pressure on airfares. Moreover, to furtherimprove margins, the airline plans to implement cost cutting measures such as reducing discre-tionary spending and improving workforce efficiencies. Nonfinancial services outlooks remainedpositive in December, and most firms expect an increase in revenue over the next six months.However, many contacts expressed concern about the negative impact of some anticipateddomestic policy changes.Construction and Real EstateHousing contacts noted mixed activity, with some reporting meeting or exceeding sales expecta-tions while others citing sluggish demand.

Credit tightening continued, but loan pricingdeclined, both at the same pace as six weeks ago. Loan nonperformance rose but at a slowerpace. In addition to swift growth in loan demand, bankers reported a sizeable pickup in generalbusiness activity for the first time in over two years. Meanwhile, bankers’ outlooks turned evenmore optimistic. They expect rapid improvement in loan demand and business activity and just amild deterioration in loan performance six months from now.EnergyOilfield activity was largely flat over the reporting period. Contacts noted that oil prices in early2025 were not expected to support an increase in production. A lower price outlook than a yearago, rising productivity, and ongoing M&A activity are expected to keep a lid on production capexgrowth, if there is any. Exploration and production contacts noted that M&A activity is expected toremain healthy through 2025 resulting in some further layoffs though most operations are “oper-ating as lean as they can already.” Job losses are also expected by oilfield services contacts pri-marily in natural gas producing regions. Narrowing margins are being driven by consolidationamong their customers, and rising insurance costs. Due to this narrowing, investment in equip-ment is expected to remain at “maintenance levels.”AgricultureDrought conditions retreated in parts of the district and remained present in others. Conditionsimproved in the cattle sector with more ample grazing—thanks to recent rainfall—and significantlyhigher calf prices. Row crop producers faced financial struggles in 2024 with largely unprofitablecrop prices, and contacts expressed continued financial concerns heading into the new year. Thewinter wheat crop is a bright spot looking ahead, with strong production prospects and soliddemand.

Employers generally notedimproved retention rates, expanded applicant pools, and higher quality candidates. Open positionswere easier to fill overall. However, a larger share of contacts expressed caution in their hiringdecisions and hesitation to adjust their headcounts going forward relative to prior reportingperiods, citing uncertainty regarding the business environment.

Looking ahead, contacts generally expected their ability to pass onhigher costs to customers to remain limited, and most said their prices will likely increase at aslower pace in 2025 relative to 2024, or even remain flat or decline.Community ConditionsDemand remained elevated for community support services such as affordable housing, foodassistance, and mental health services. Funding for nonprofit organizations from both individualdonors and government sources fell. Contacts across the District reported that public and privateeducational institutions of all levels faced tighter financial conditions due to lower funding inflowsand higher labor costs. Generally easing inflation trends lessened strain on small businesses,though challenges persisted with insurance premiums, rents, and financing costs. Small busi-nesses and nonprofit organizations reported that recent integration of software technologiesallowed them to expand their outreach efforts and provide more personalized services.Retail Trade and ServicesRetail sales expanded modestly over the reporting period. Contacts observed a solid holiday shop-ping season, similar to last year’s spending. Retailers noted higher demand for outdoor productsand increased foot traffic in shopping centers across the District. Sales at organic specialty storesreportedly outpaced those at regular grocery stores, particularly in the Mountain West states. Con-sumers continued to take advantage of promotional pricing, which bolstered overall retail sales.However, demand for some products reportedly softened, including pet specialty items and woodproducts at home improvement stores. Retailers generally reported adequate inventory levels,although they were somewhat lower than levels observed last year.Activity in consumer and business services was stable to slightly up in recent weeks. Activity inthe leisure and hospitality sector picked up on balance, with increased travel demand from groupsand businesses that slightly offset flat demand for leisure travel. Reports indicated lower guestcounts at bars and restaurants in recent weeks, which were impacted by bad weather in parts ofthe District despite typical holiday-related activity.

Demand was stable foragricultural and animal products such as fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy. Yields of food cropswere solid but down compared to prior harvests. Drought conditions in the Mountain Westnegatively affected grain yields, while growers in California reported that water supply was not anissue. Exports of almonds fell. Log harvesting activity experienced seasonal slowing, whichreduced market supply and put upward pressure on log prices. Additionally, log exports remainedlow because of muted demand from China. Materials and agricultural inputs were generally avail-able. Some contacts reported persistent challenges with labor availability and generally highenergy costs.Real Estate and ConstructionResidential real estate activity was largely unchanged from the last reporting period. Highfinancing costs and excess supply of multifamily housing properties continued to hold back newresidential construction projects. Finding skilled labor remained a challenge.

Municipal construction projects hadbeen a key source of demand in recent years, but municipal development activity is waning as theavailability of public funds and outlook for fiscal spending dwindle. Contacts indicated more privatesector customers are coming to the table to satisfy pent-up demand from delayed developmentprojects and deferred maintenance, offsetting the declines in municipal projects. In particular, con-tacts highlighted growth in demand for construction of healthcare facilities. Demand for single-family home building also firmed slightly, primarily in luxury segments or homes with large foot-prints. Overall expectations for construction activity were favorable for the next six months, withcontacts indicating an outlook for modest growth.Community and Regional BankingLoan demand and credit standards were mostly unchanged across categories. However, the trendof lower demand for residential mortgage loans continued. Concerns related to credit performanceover the next six months were less prevalent overall but shifted notably to different segments ofthe regional economy. Much of the improvement in the outlook around credit performance was dueto concerns with commercial real estate loans being modified in the lower interest rate environ-ment. In contrast, contacts reported more pessimism for agriculture loans, as grain pricesremained low. Deposit levels were stable, though bankers noted a continued migration into certifi-cate of deposit accounts and money market accounts, as customers took advantage of the cur-rent rate environment.EnergyTenth District oil and gas activity fell modestly. While most contacts reported no change in activity,approximately a quarter of businesses reported declines. The number of active oil rigs in the Dis-trict fell slightly, while gas rig counts rose as natural gas prices now meet the average breakevenprice reported by firms. Despite declining revenues and profits, District firms raised capital expen-ditures and employment substantially from this time last year.

However, several contacts downgraded the chances of significant rate declines in 2025.Office leasing activity remained slow, but prime Boston properties continued to experience rela-tively healthy activity. Contacts described industrial and retail leasing activity as stable. Rents andoccupancy rates were unchanged across all asset classes.

Around half of contacts were cautiously optimistic that the first quarter of 2025would bring more robust commercial real estate activity, while others expected current activitylevels to persist or, more pessimistically, that interest rates would stay higher for longer than previ-ously expected and exert negative impacts on the market.Residential Real EstateHome sales in the First District rose modestly on a year-over-year basis in November 2024, themost recent month for which data was available. Supporting the increase in sales, home invento-ries were up moderately from a year ago overall, with very large increases in Maine and Vermont,although inventories declined moderately in Massachusetts from a year earlier. However, thetypical number of days homes spent on the market increased, as multiple contacts mentionedthat some buyers were waiting until after the presidential election to make purchasing decisions.Considering changes since November 2023, prices of single-family homes increased at a briskpace, while condo prices increased moderately on average in Massachusetts and Rhode Islandbut decreased modestly in the northern New England states. Multiple contacts expressed opti-mism that more sellers would put their homes on the market in early 2025 and that this wouldlead to increased sales activity.

However, the trendof lower demand for residential mortgage loans continued. Concerns related to credit performanceover the next six months were less prevalent overall but shifted notably to different segments ofthe regional economy. Much of the improvement in the outlook around credit performance was dueto concerns with commercial real estate loans being modified in the lower interest rate environ-ment.

The number of active oil rigs in the Dis-trict fell slightly, while gas rig counts rose as natural gas prices now meet the average breakevenprice reported by firms.

      "Question:  1. What are the latest GDP growth rates for major economies worldwide?  \n",
      "Answer:  The provided context from the Beige Book does not contain specific information about the latest GDP growth rates for major economies worldwide. The Beige Book primarily focuses on qualitative assessments of economic conditions within the 12 Federal Reserve Districts in the United States, including employment, wages, prices, and sector-specific activities like manufacturing, retail, and real estate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To find the latest GDP growth rates for major economies worldwide, you would need to consult sources such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, or national statistical agencies, which regularly publish updated economic data, including GDP growth rates. These sources provide comprehensive and up-to-date information on global economic performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question:  2. How are inflation rates trending in different regions as of the current year?  \n",
      "Answer:  The provided context from the Beige Book offers insights into inflation trends across different regions as of the current year (2025). Here are the key observations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **General Inflation Trends**: Inflation appears to be moderating in many areas, particularly at the wholesale and retail levels. For example, construction survey respondents noted that while inflation remains a problem, prices are moderating compared to the previous year. Additionally, an alcoholic beverage retailer mentioned that suppliers were offering deep end-of-year discounts to clear inventories, which were passed on to customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Regional Variations**:\n",
      "   - **Montana**: Retail fuel prices fell moderately, contrasting with most of the District where prices were roughly flat.\n",
      "   - **Agricultural Prices**: Prices received by farmers showed mixed trends. Prices increased for sugar beets, chickens, eggs, milk, hogs, and cattle, but decreased for corn, soybeans, wheat, barley, potatoes, canola, lentils, hay, and turkeys.\n",
      "   - **Southeast**: Supply constraints from avian flu drove up the price of table eggs, while demand for poultry remained steady.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sector-Specific Inflation**:\n",
      "   - **Construction and Real Estate**: High costs for materials and financing were noted as factors weighing on growth in construction activity.\n",
      "   - **Consumer Goods**: Retailers reported strong holiday sales, with some stores seeing sales surpass pre-pandemic levels, indicating that consumer spending remained robust despite inflationary pressures.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Wage and Labor Costs**: Wage growth picked up to a moderate pace in most Districts, though there were some reports of easing wage pressures. This suggests that labor costs are contributing to inflationary pressures but may be stabilizing in some areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, inflation rates are trending downward in some sectors and regions, particularly at the wholesale and retail levels, but remain a concern in others, such as construction and agriculture. Wage growth and sector-specific factors like avian flu are also influencing inflation trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question:  3. What are the recent changes in global unemployment rates and labor market conditions?\n",
      "Answer:  The provided context from the Beige Book offers insights into recent changes in labor market conditions, particularly within the United States, but does not provide specific data on global unemployment rates. Here are the key observations regarding labor market conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Employment Growth**: Employment has shown slight increases in several regions. For example:\n",
      "   - The **Ninth District** (Minneapolis) reported slight employment growth, with positive but slowing labor demand. Hiring remained healthy in sectors like health care, construction, and finance, but manufacturing saw a decline in orders and hiring.\n",
      "   - The **Eleventh District** (Dallas) noted a slight rise in overall employment in December, with growth in services employment but flat manufacturing employment.\n",
      "   - The **Seventh District** (Chicago) reported a slight increase in employment, with some signs of softening in the labor market, such as reduced hours or layoffs in certain sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Labor Demand and Availability**: Labor demand has been positive but slowing in many areas. Employers reported improved labor availability, with some regions noting a shift from labor shortages to a more balanced market. For instance:\n",
      "   - In the **Ninth District**, staffing contacts reported more candidates than jobs, a reversal of earlier conditions.\n",
      "   - In the **Eleventh District**, there was an adequate supply of low-skilled labor but a tight supply of skilled workers, leading some firms to consider hiring remote workers abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Wage Growth**: Wage growth has been moderate across most regions, with some signs of easing wage pressures:\n",
      "   - In the **Ninth District**, wage growth was slightly lower than earlier in the year, though still strong in construction and finance.\n",
      "   - In the **Eleventh District**, wage growth remained moderate, but firms anticipated slower wage growth in the upcoming year.\n",
      "   - In the **Seventh District**, wages and benefits costs continued to rise moderately, with some contacts reporting increased health insurance costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sector-Specific Trends**: Certain sectors experienced unique labor market conditions:\n",
      "   - **Manufacturing**: Employment was flat or declining in some regions, with reduced demand for labor.\n",
      "   - **Retail**: Holiday labor needs were less challenging compared to previous years, with some retailers hiring fewer temporary workers and relying on existing staff to work more hours.\n",
      "   - **Construction**: Hiring remained healthy in some regions, but high costs for materials and financing weighed on growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Outlook**: Contacts generally expected employment growth to continue at a similar pace over the next 12 months, though some expressed concerns about potential challenges, such as the need for skilled workers and the impact of future immigration and trade policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, recent labor market conditions in the U.S. show slight employment growth, moderating wage pressures, and a shift toward a more balanced labor market in some regions. However, the context does not provide specific information on global unemployment rates, which would require data from international sources like the International Labour Organization (ILO) or national statistical agencies.\n",

Energy activity increased, but agri-culture demand declined.Labor MarketsEmployment was little changed in recent weeks, as firms held headcounts steady. Many contactsplan to keep staffing levels flat into 2025, although some expect to reduce headcount slightly,largely through attrition. A few reported they may need to pursue layoffs if demand softens. How-ever, there were a few reports of hiring for growth.

Most said expectations for 2025 wage increases wereroughly in line with pre-pandemic growth rates, and similar to or slightly below those observed in2024. Easing wage inflation was particularly notable among white-collar workers. Only a minorityof contacts noted continued elevated wage pressures for some roles such as frontline workers,union employees, or skilled roles that are difficult to fill.PricesInput costs and prices increased modestly over the reporting period. Insurance and laborremained the principal cost concerns for firms. While some contacts reported a slight moderationin insurance cost increases, even relatively modest increases in insurance costs created costpressures for firms. On the health insurance side, many employers planned to pass on costincreases to employees, but increases in other types of insurance were likely to be passedthrough to final prices.

Consumer spending moved up moderately, with most Districtsreporting strong holiday sales that exceeded expectations. Vehicle sales grew modestly. Construc-tion activity decreased overall, with several Districts indicating that high costs for materials andfinancing were weighing on growth. Manufacturing decreased slightly on net, and a number of Dis-tricts said manufacturers were stockpiling inventories in anticipation of higher tariffs. Residentialreal estate activity was unchanged on balance, as high mortgage rates continued to hold backdemand. Commercial real estate sales edged up. The nonfinancial services sector grew slightlyoverall, with Districts highlighting growth in leisure and hospitality and transportation, notably airtravel. Truck freight volumes, however, were down. Financial service providers reported modestgrowth in lending and little change in asset quality overall, though lenders and community organi-zations voiced concerns about delinquencies among small businesses and lower-income house-holds. Nonprofit social service agencies faced high demand amidst uncertainty about futurefunding levels. Agricultural conditions remained weak overall, with generally lower farm incomesand weather-related struggles in some areas. The spread of avian flu reduced egg supplies andpushed up prices. Energy activity was mixed. More contacts were optimistic about the outlook for2025 than were pessimistic about it, though contacts in several Districts expressed concerns thatchanges in immigration and tariff policy could negatively affect the economy.Labor MarketsEmployment ticked up on balance, with six Districts reporting a slight increase and six reportingno change. Contacts in several service industries, notably healthcare, continued to see jobgrowth. Construction employment increased slightly, while manufacturing employment was flat.Contacts across multiple sectors noted difficulty finding skilled workers, and reports of layoffsremained rare. However, contacts in some Districts expressed greater uncertainty about theirfuture staffing needs. Wage growth picked up to a moderate pace in most Districts, though therewere some reports that wage pressures had eased.Note: This report was prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago based on information collected on or beforeJanuary 6, 2025, and thus, before the wildfires in the Greater Los Angeles area started.

Contacts expected revenues to increase strongly in the first quarter of 2025, based on acombination of organic growth in demand and, in one case, the recent acquisition of another com-pany. Considering the longer-term outlook, most contacts expressed confidence that demand fortheir products would continue to rise, even in an environment of heightened political and macro-economic uncertainty. Nonetheless, one firm said that increased competition from China affectingits clients could either boost its business, as client firms invested in new technologies to keep up,or hurt demand if clients were pushed out of the market altogether by such competition.Commercial Real EstateCommercial real estate activity was mostly flat in the First District. Contacts reported uniformlythat elevated long-term interest rates continued to limit transactions. One contact said that bor-rowers, hoping that long-term rates would decline, continued to favor extensions for maturingloans. However, several contacts downgraded the chances of significant rate declines in 2025.Office leasing activity remained slow, but prime Boston properties continued to experience rela-tively healthy activity. Contacts described industrial and retail leasing activity as stable. Rents andoccupancy rates were unchanged across all asset classes. One contact said that a recent Massa-chusetts law intended to promote multifamily construction was yielding tangible results in someareas of the state. Around half of contacts were cautiously optimistic that the first quarter of 2025would bring more robust commercial real estate activity, while others expected current activitylevels to persist or, more pessimistically, that interest rates would stay higher for longer than previ-ously expected and exert negative impacts on the market.Residential Real EstateHome sales in the First District rose modestly on a year-over-year basis in November 2024, themost recent month for which data was available. Supporting the increase in sales, home invento-ries were up moderately from a year ago overall, with very large increases in Maine and Vermont,although inventories declined moderately in Massachusetts from a year earlier. However, thetypical number of days homes spent on the market increased, as multiple contacts mentionedthat some buyers were waiting until after the presidential election to make purchasing decisions.Considering changes since November 2023, prices of single-family homes increased at a briskpace, while condo prices increased moderately on average in Massachusetts and Rhode Islandbut decreased modestly in the northern New England states. Multiple contacts expressed opti-mism that more sellers would put their homes on the market in early 2025 and that this wouldlead to increased sales activity.
