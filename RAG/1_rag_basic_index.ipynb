It characterizes regional economic conditions and pros-pects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District’ssources. Reports are published eight times per year.What is the purpose of the Beige Book?The Beige Book is intended to characterize the change in economic conditions since the lastreport. Outreach for the Beige Book is one of many ways the Federal Reserve System engageswith businesses and other organizations about economic developments in their communities.Because this information is collected from a wide range of contacts through a variety of formaland informal methods, the Beige Book can complement other forms of regional information gath-ering. The Beige Book is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.How is the information collected?Each Federal Reserve Bank gathers information on current economic conditions in its Districtthrough reports from Bank and Branch directors, plus interviews and online questionnaires com-pleted by businesses, community organizations, economists, market experts, and other sources.Contacts are not selected at random; rather, Banks strive to curate a diverse set of sources thatcan provide accurate and objective information about a broad range of economic activities. TheBeige Book serves as a regular summary of this information for the public.How is the information used?The information from contacts supplements the data and analysis used by Federal Reserve econo-mists and staff to assess economic conditions in the Federal Reserve Districts. The qualitativenature of the Beige Book creates an opportunity to characterize dynamics and identify emergingtrends in the economy that may not be readily apparent in the available economic data. This infor-Note: The Federal Reserve officially identifies Districts by number and Reserve Bank city. In the 12th District, the SeattleBranch serves Alaska, and the San Francisco Bank serves Hawaii.

Citing softer demand, some manufacturers noted decreasingtheir prices to compete for business.Consumer SpendingOn balance, consumer spending increased moderately in recent weeks after a period of declineover several reporting periods, and contacts generally expected sales to increase modestly in thecoming months. Most reports of stronger sales were centered on holiday shopping, and onegrocer noted that “customers appear[ed] willing to spend more this holiday season.” Reports fromauto dealers remained mixed. Most dealers continued to report soft demand for new and usedvehicles; however, two dealers reported unexpected increases in sales. Some auto dealers wereoptimistic about sales in the coming months as loan rates had fallen somewhat for customerswith higher credit scores.ManufacturingDemand for manufactured goods was generally stable after declining for several reporting periods,and most firms reported no change in demand. Still, some manufacturers noted low demandrelated to general uncertainty about potential policy changes. By contrast, a small number ofreports indicated higher orders, a circumstance which some contacts attributed to data centerconstruction and others to greater overall confidence in the economy.

Imports of assembled vehicles dropped byalmost half at one port while another port saw a moderate increase in auto parts. Multiple portsnoted a significant decrease in paper waste products exported to East Asia. Ports attributed lack-luster cargo volumes to US big-box retailers cautiously rerouting to the West Coast in advance ofdisruptions if contract negotiations with the International Longshoreman Association are notsettled in January.

Surveys and individual contacts suggested thatlabor demand remained positive but also continued to slow, especially for certain sectors. Hiringin health care, construction, and finance remained healthy. However, staffing contacts mostlyreported that clients were not hiring, particularly in manufacturing. “Orders are down, there’s noway to sugarcoat it,” said a contact in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula (U.P.). Employers widelyreported that labor availability continued to improve and felt “more normal,” according to onesource. Some staffing contacts reported that there were more candidates than jobs, a flip-flop ofearlier labor conditions. Others noted improvements in job candidates’ reliability. A Minnesota mallcontact reported that holiday labor needs “seem to be less of a challenge this year than the pastfew years. I can’t think of one retail tenant that is or was concerned with staffing.”Wage growth was moderate. Monthly survey respondents reported wage growth roughly on par withrecent months, but slightly lower than the first half of the year. Wage growth was stronger amongconstruction and finance contacts, but lower for job orders at staffing firms due to saggingdemand. A South Dakota retail contact reported that the rate of wage increase “has slowed andhas been relatively flat for several months now,” but it was still comparatively high and cutting intoprofitability.PricesOverall prices increased slightly since the previous report.

In contrast, about40 percent of firms reported an increase in nonlabor input prices for the month. The wholesaleprices component of a regional manufacturing index ticked up slightly in December to a moderateoverall level. Respondents to a construction survey continued to report that inflation was aproblem, but they also indicated that prices were nonetheless moderating at the wholesale andretail level compared with last year. An alcoholic beverage retailer said that suppliers were clearinginventories by offering deep end-of-year discounts, which they passed along to customers. Retailfuel prices were roughly flat since the last report in most of the District except for Montana, wherethey fell moderately. Prices received by farmers increased in November from a year earlier forsugar beets, chickens, eggs, milk, hogs, and cattle; prices decreased from a year earlier for corn,soybeans, wheat, barley, potatoes, canola, lentils, hay, and turkeys.Worker ExperienceWorkforce development contacts across the District reported a slight softening in job openings butnoted that demand remained robust for some health care and construction jobs. Contacts high-lighted ongoing challenges matching available talent to those high-demand occupations. Midcareerjob seekers looking for management opportunities struggled, because those jobs were scarce. Aunion contact said that hiring commercial drivers, mechanics, and law enforcement professionalsin some areas of the U.P. was a “perpetual struggle.” They added that public employees kept“moving backwards,” facing stagnant wages and a higher cost of living.Consumer SpendingConsumer spending grew modestly. Retail contacts were generally upbeat about holiday sales.Stores reported strong crowds, with some seeing sales surpass pre-pandemic levels for the firsttime. One Minnesota mall contact expected sales increases from three percent to five percentover last year. Another Minnesota contact said that “traffic is up and a lot of people [are] carryingbags.” Some restaurants in Minneapolis-St. Paul reported slow holiday event bookings and loweroverall sales. Sentiment among retailers in South Dakota was also somewhat softer, and a sourcethere noted a spate of recent restaurant and brewery closings. Some contacts noted healthy con-sumer spending, but also expressed caution regarding rising consumer debt, particularly amongmiddle- and low-income households. Hotel occupancy softened across the District, though Wis-consin operators saw decent gains. Vehicle sales were flat overall, with higher sales of newvehicles but lower sales among used vehicles.Construction and Real EstateConstruction grew slightly overall since the last report.

Office space was still widely lower across most District mar-kets. Industrial space continued to soften somewhat, with increased subleasing in some markets,but conditions were still considered healthy. Multifamily vacancy rates ticked higher. Retail con-tinued to perform well in many markets, buoyed by strong holiday foot traffic and tight vacancyrates. Residential real estate was widely higher. A large majority of markets saw growth in recenthome sales year over year, including strong, double-digit increases in Montana markets.ManufacturingActivity in manufacturing decreased moderately in the District since the previous report. Prelimi-nary results from an annual survey of manufacturers indicated a contraction in 2024 from the pre-vious year. Manufacturers responding to a monthly business survey reported orders decreased inDecember from the previous month, and more than 20 percent reported large reductions. A metalfabricator reported that incoming order volumes were “falling dramatically compared to the pastsix months, which were themselves down significantly from last year.” In contrast, another index ofregional manufacturing conditions found activity increased in Minnesota and North Dakota inDecember relative to the previous month, while activity in South Dakota decreased.Agriculture Energy and Natural ResourcesDistrict agricultural conditions remained weak. An overwhelming majority of contacts reported thatfarm incomes fell in the fourth quarter from a year earlier due to low crop prices. Livestock pro-ducers continued to outperform crop producers. District oil and gas exploration activity was steadysince the previous report.Minority- and Women-Owned Business EnterprisesActivity among minority- and women-owned business enterprises was lower on balance over themonth.

Contacts indicated consumers are increasingly using longer-term financing and con-solidating debt to manage household cash flows and support ongoing spending. Growth in con-sumer spending supported modest hiring activity concentrated in service sectors. Similarly, pricesrose at a modest pace overall but rose faster among consumer-oriented businesses. Contactsbroadly reported expectations that growth and hiring will accelerate in coming months, driven byfaster consumer spending, growth in manufacturing demand and rising construction activity. Con-tacts also noted several risks to their favorable outlooks. Agriculture and leisure and hospitalitybusinesses highlighted risks to their capacity that could arise from potential changes in immigra-tion policy. Professional service sectors with large technology outlays expressed concerns aboutsourcing equipment amid potential tariffs and are already adjusting inventories.Labor MarketsEmployment levels grew slightly over the past month and business contacts expected faster jobgrowth early in the new year. Recent hiring activity was concentrated in services sectors, andwages for service workers continued to grow at a moderate pace. While hiring and wage growthwere subdued in manufacturing, contacts shared the favorable employment outlook. District firmsreported limited reliance on immigrant labor in general, but contacts in select industries andregions expressed concerns that potential immigration policy changes could exacerbate alreadytight labor market conditions by limiting the supply of labor. Food manufacturing and agriculturalcontacts in Kansas and Nebraska indicated restrictions on temporary migrant labor could lead tosignificant supply constraints. Similarly, leisure and hospitality contacts in Colorado suggestedimmigration restrictions could exacerbate labor shortages in towns near resort communities. Tech-nology industry contacts expressed additional concerns surrounding the ability to employ overseastechnology workers if offshoring policies were to shift.PricesPrices continued to grow slowly over the last month, driven by consumer goods and servicesprices.

Fasterinput price growth was a noted driver of higher expected prices across goods and services for thecoming year. In general, businesses were not able to pass along recent cost pressures butexpressed plans to do so.Consumer SpendingConsumer spending grew slightly over the last month, driven by growth in discretionary spendingand auto purchases. Overall leisure and hospitality spending continued to rise, albeit with somesigns of a softer outlook ahead. Casino operators in New Mexico reported fewer visits and lowerspending per visit, and contacts at Oklahoma casinos indicated the outlook for 2025 is lower thanthe previous two years. Ski resort contacts noted busy early-season bookings and a sold-outholiday season. However, out-of-state powder hounds opted for lower cost basic passes to save ontheir ski vacations and locals were reportedly less likely to book lodging in advance, gambling thatlower prices on vacant lodging would be available. While durable consumption contracted over thepast month, auto purchases grew moderately driven by pent-up demand as many consumers madeyear-end vehicle purchases. Consumers reportedly took on long-term financing (often more than72 months) to reduce monthly auto payments in an effort to manage household budgetconstraints.Community ConditionsContacts reported low- and moderate-income (LMI) consumers were struggling with increasing debtburdens. Most contacts said that they were seeing higher credit card utilization, increasing debt-to-income ratios, and delinquencies. Community development financial institutions contacts notedmore clients were seeking consolidation loans due to higher debt burdens. Contacts indicated LMIpopulations continued to struggle with food and housing prices, as the ability to offset prices waslimited due to higher earnings pushing households toward a benefits cliff with a potential loss ingovernment benefits. One contact noted workers would need at least a 10 to 15 percent increasein wages to offset lost benefits but were only finding jobs with much smaller increases.Manufacturing and Other Business ActivityActivity in service sectors grew moderately over the past month, largely driven by consumer-facingservices rather than business services. Contacts shared that households within the region hadsome pent-up demand for purchases that were delayed due to economic concerns that subsidedrecently. Service firms continue to face pressure on profit margins as input prices rose faster thanselling prices. Margin pressures were further exacerbated by higher overhead costs.

The manu-facturing sector continued experiencing a slight decline in activity. Nonetheless, manufacturingfirms remained optimist, anticipating greater activity in the early part of next year driven byimprovement in future production and new orders.Real Estate and ConstructionThe level of construction activity was unchanged in recent months, however several contacts notedsubstantial shifts in the sources of construction demand. Municipal construction projects hadbeen a key source of demand in recent years, but municipal development activity is waning as theavailability of public funds and outlook for fiscal spending dwindle. Contacts indicated more privatesector customers are coming to the table to satisfy pent-up demand from delayed developmentprojects and deferred maintenance, offsetting the declines in municipal projects. In particular, con-tacts highlighted growth in demand for construction of healthcare facilities. Demand for single-family home building also firmed slightly, primarily in luxury segments or homes with large foot-prints. Overall expectations for construction activity were favorable for the next six months, withcontacts indicating an outlook for modest growth.Community and Regional BankingLoan demand and credit standards were mostly unchanged across categories. However, the trendof lower demand for residential mortgage loans continued. Concerns related to credit performanceover the next six months were less prevalent overall but shifted notably to different segments ofthe regional economy. Much of the improvement in the outlook around credit performance was dueto concerns with commercial real estate loans being modified in the lower interest rate environ-ment. In contrast, contacts reported more pessimism for agriculture loans, as grain pricesremained low. Deposit levels were stable, though bankers noted a continued migration into certifi-cate of deposit accounts and money market accounts, as customers took advantage of the cur-rent rate environment.EnergyTenth District oil and gas activity fell modestly. While most contacts reported no change in activity,approximately a quarter of businesses reported declines. The number of active oil rigs in the Dis-trict fell slightly, while gas rig counts rose as natural gas prices now meet the average breakevenprice reported by firms.

Corn prices also remained weak despite increasing slightly fol-lowing recent reports of higher than anticipated export activity. Strong market conditions and highprices supported broad strength in the cattle industry, but incomes were dampened in some areasheavily affected by drought.

Revenuegrowth was led by trade, transportation, and utilities as well as professional and business ser-vices. Revenues fell in information and leisure and hospitality. A transportation services firmreported a small increase in parcel volumes, while another contact noted that despite slowgrowth, overall parcel volumes in 2024 will match the 2022 record-breaking level.

Meanwhile, bankers’ outlooks turned evenmore optimistic. They expect rapid improvement in loan demand and business activity and just amild deterioration in loan performance six months from now.EnergyOilfield activity was largely flat over the reporting period. Contacts noted that oil prices in early2025 were not expected to support an increase in production. A lower price outlook than a yearago, rising productivity, and ongoing M&A activity are expected to keep a lid on production capexgrowth, if there is any. Exploration and production contacts noted that M&A activity is expected toremain healthy through 2025 resulting in some further layoffs though most operations are “oper-ating as lean as they can already.” Job losses are also expected by oilfield services contacts pri-marily in natural gas producing regions. Narrowing margins are being driven by consolidationamong their customers, and rising insurance costs. Due to this narrowing, investment in equip-ment is expected to remain at “maintenance levels.”AgricultureDrought conditions retreated in parts of the district and remained present in others.
