Henson, Daniil Manaenkov, and Yinuo Zhang \\nUniversity of Michigan \\nExecutive Summary\\nLong Story Short \\nWe project the U.S. economy to maintain healthy \\nmomentum throughout our forecast window, with a \\nmodest deceleration in the near term. We expect real \\nGDP growth to average about 2.0 percent annualized in \\nthe second half of 2024, while the unemployment rate \\ncontinues inching up to 4.0 percent. Meaningful  \\nprogress towards inflation normalization, coupled with a \\ngradually softening labor market, set the stage for the \\nfirst fed funds rate cut of this cycle in September 2024. \\nLook beyond the Headline \\nThe pace of real GDP growth moderated to an \\nannualized rate of 1.6 percent in 2024Q1. While net \\nexports subtracted nearly 0.9 percentage points from \\ntopline GDP growth, the underlying momentum remains \\nsolid. The combined growth contributions of private \\nconsumption and fixed investment  added 2.6 \\npercentage points to growth in the first quarter, just 0.2 \\npercentage points behind the 2023Q4 reading.  \\nThe recent upward revision in net immigration \\nestimates for 2022‚Äì23 by the CBO suggest s that the \\nbrisk economic growth in 2023 was likely supported by \\nan immigration wave fueling both the demand and the \\nsupply sides of the economy. \\nControlled Deceleration in The Labor Market \\nMonthly payroll job gains have moderated to 246,000 \\nso far in 2024, well above 2019's average pace of \\n166,000. The headline unemployment rate inched up to \\n3.9 percent in April after averaging 3.7 percent in \\n2023H2. We project a continued softening of the labor \\nmarket through early 2025.  \\nWe revised up our population growth projections for \\n2024‚Äì25 to reflect a higher immigration forecast . This \\nwill boost the size and growth of the population, \\nprimarily in the 25 to 54 age group, resulting in stronger \\nlabor force growth in our forecast. \\nPotholes along the Last Mile \\nComing after the rapid disinflation at the end of 2023, \\nthe recent spike in inflation suggests that the last mile \\nof inflation normalization may take longer than many \\nhad hoped. The recent rebound has been broad-based \\nacross goods and services. The core PCE price index, \\na key metric for forecasting future inflation, was up 2.8 \\npercent year over year in March. The pace of monthly \\ncore PCE inflation previously registered at or below the \\n2.0 percent annual pace in five of the six months from \\nJuly to December 2023, but it spiked to 6.2 percent in \\nJanuary 2024.

Despite recent improvements in the \\nnumber of active for -sale listings , elevated mortgage \\nrates are locking many potential sellers into the low-rate \\nmortgages they secured in the past. On the other hand, \\nannualized sales of new single-family homes increased \\nfrom 2023Q4 to 2024Q1, a trend we generally expect to \\ncontinue over our forecast period. We remain cautiously \\noptimistic about the single -family residential \\nconstruction market, which should benefit from the \\nprojected decline in mortgage rates in the second half \\nof 2024. \\nCongress Arrives Fashionably Late  \\nCongress passed a full-year funding package by the \\nend of March , more than five months after fiscal 2024 \\nbegan. We consider a timely resolution to the fiscal \\n2025 budget unlikely as well. Because we judge that a \\ndivided government is the most likely outcome of the \\n2024 elections, our fiscal forecast features the path of \\nleast resistance:  a slowdown in discretionary \\nnondefense spending growth alongside steady \\nincreases in defense spending. \\nThe federal deficit is set to ease slightly  thanks to the \\nrecent jump in personal tax revenues. It is projected to \\nstep down from 5.8 percent of GDP in fiscal 2023 to 5.2 \\npercent in fiscal 2025. The privately held debt -to-GDP \\nratio is poised to increase from 80.9 percent in 2024Q1 \\nto 84.6 percent in 2025Q4, as sizeable deficits continue. \\nThe 2024‚Äì2025 Outlook \\nDespite the recent spike, our baseline forecast is that \\ninflation will resume its normalization as shelter costs \\ndecelerate and consumer goods inflation remains \\nmuted. The year -over-year change in the PCE price \\nindex ticks up from 2.6 percent in 2024Q1 to 2.9 percent \\nin 2024Q4, before moderating to 2.1 percent by the \\nsecond half of 2025. Year -over-year core CPI inflation \\nlingers around 3.5 percent through the rest of 2024 and \\nthen slows to 2.5 percent by 2025Q4.  \\nWe anticipate consumers to begin exercising more \\ncaution as the unemployment rate creeps up slightly in \\nthe second half of 2024. As a result, the growth pace of \\nGDP is projected to slow to an average of about 2.0 \\npercent annualized in 2024H2. As inflation decelerates \\nand the effects of the projected policy rate cuts feed \\nthrough the economy, growth then accelerates in 2025, \\nrising to 2.4 percent annualized in 2025Q4.  \\nWe expect the labor market to c ontinue cooling off \\ngradually. The unemployment  rate ticks up  to 4.0 \\npercent by 2024Q4 and hovers at that level throughout \\n2025. Job gains continue to slow through 2025Q1, after \\nwhich they stabilize around 120,000 ‚Äì130,000 per \\nmonth. \\nWe expect the  pace of single- family housing starts  to \\nclimb by 60,000 units through 2025Q4 after hovering at \\n1,030,000 units in the near term. We project a gradual \\nrecovery of multi -family starts to an annual pace of \\n440,000 units by 2025Q4, despite the recent decline in \\n2024Q1. \\nThe pace of light vehicle sales is expected to start rising \\nagain in 2024H2.

Although that performance fell short \\nof expectations, the main drivers of growth \\nremained strong. Chart 1 shows the growth \\nrate of real GDP and the growth contributions \\nof its major components over the past two \\nyears. Net exports subtracted nearly 0.9 \\npercentage points from topline GDP growth in \\nthe first quarter after contributing one-quarter of a point in the fourth quarter of 2023. The government's \\ngrowth contribution likewise decreased from 0.8 to 0.2 percentage points. Consumption contributed a \\nhealthy 1.7 percentage points to annualized real GDP growth, nonetheless a step down from the 2.2 \\npercentage points in 2023Q4. The combined growth contributions of private consumption and fixed \\ninvestment, which we believe to be more informative about the underlying momentum in the economy, \\nadded 2.6 percentage points to growth in the first quarter, just 0.2 percentage points behind the 2023Q4 \\nreading.   \\nOur economic outlook hinges on the near-term trajectory of inflation. The recent spike suggests \\nthat the last mile of inflation normalization may \\ntake longer than many observers had hoped \\nafter the rapid disinflation at the end of 2023. \\nThe Fed targets Personal Consumption \\nExpenditure (PCE) inflation at an average pace \\nof 2.0 percent per year.

However, the recent surge to 4.1 percent on an annualized basis has \\nintroduced new pockets of turbulence on the flight path to a soft landing. \\nUntil recently, PCE housing services inflation had been moderating from its previously high level. \\nHowever, it stalled around 5.8 percent year over year in February‚ÄìMarch. The PCE housing services \\nprice index includes imputed rental of owner -occupied homes and direct rental costs of all renter \\nhouseholds, whether or not they have moved or signed a new lease. This focus on a broad target \\npopulation helps to explain the slow dynamics \\nof PCE housing services inflation. Measures of \\nrent inflation for new tenants can potentially \\ncapture timelier trends in the rental market and \\nhelp predict the future evolution of the PCE \\nrental component.

The painful realization that the Fed's rate cuts would be delayed in the \\nface of resurgent inflation and a string of strong \\njobs reports has put upward pressure on \\nlonger-term rates this year. The yield on 5-year \\nTreasury debt climbed by 60 bps between \\nJanuary and April, before retreating by around \\n10 bps following the FOMC meeting in early \\nMay. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate crept up \\nabove 7.0 percent again, standing at 7.1 \\npercent as of early May. Despite these  shifts, \\nthe 48-month new car loan rate has held steady at 7.8 percent since late December , already one of the \\nhighest levels seen since 2001.  \\nOne potential explanation for the recent economic strength in the face of much tighter monetary \\npolicy is the ongoing immigration wave.

Correspondingly, we have also \\nrevised our population growth projections for \\n2024 and beyond, resulting in stronger labor \\nforce growth in the forecast.  \\nThe labor market has shown \\ndiscernible signs of cooling off recently. \\nMonthly payroll job gains moderated to \\n175,000 in April, coming off from their prior 3-\\nmonth average of 270,000. Government job gains dropped below 10,000 for the first time since \\nDecember 2022, having averaged about \\n59,000 over 2023.

Data from \\nIndeed.com, which appears to be a leading \\nindicator of the private job openings rate, \\nsuggests that the decelerating trend of job \\nopenings is likely to continue in the near term .

We expect high mortgage rates to restrain residential single -family \\nconstruction activity in the near term, but we remain cautiously optimistic that activity will ramp up along \\nwith net immigration.   \\nMortgage rates that briefly rose toward the 8.0 percent level led to a deceleration of home price \\nappreciation in the second half of 2023 as the \\npace of new for -sale listings began its \\nrecovery. The small re- acceleration of home \\nprices in early 2024 likely stemmed from rates \\ntemporarily dipping below 7.0 percent around \\nthe turn of the year. The number of active \\nlistings, as reported weekly by the National \\nAssociation of Realtors (NAR), has improved \\nmeasurably relative to 2023, suggesting that some sellers are finally coming back to the market.

We believe that the \\ncurrent picture is consistent with a slight deceleration in economic growth in the near term, but healthy \\ngrowth throughout our forecast window. \\nNext, we outline several key policy and economic assumptions underlying our forecast. \\nMonetary Policy \\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains committed to bringing inflation down to its \\n2.0 percent objective. The FOMC has held the federal funds rate steady at 5.25‚Äì5.5 percent since July \\n2023. After the May  meeting, FOMC members signaled that the current pause would continue for the \\ntime being. Members made sure to note that \"job gains have remained strong\" and \"there has been a \\nlack of further progress toward the Committee\\'s 2 percent inflation objective.\" In addition, the committee \\nrepeated the comment \"that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals have moved toward'),\n",

The median Committee member saw three cuts in 2024 \\nand three or four more in 2025. The Committee maintained its belief that inflation would continue to \\nnormalize, with the participants \\' median projection of year -over-year PCE price index inflation falling to \\n2.4 percent by the end of this year and 2.2  percent by the end of 2025. At the same time, the median \\nprojection saw the unemployment rate rising to 4.0 percent this year and 4.1 percent in 2025. It is worth \\nnoting that since the March meeting, the inflation data has largely surprised to the upside, which led Fed \\nChair Jay Powell to say, \"the recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate \\nthat it\\'s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.\" \\nCore PCE inflation, a key metric for forecasting future inflation, stood at 2.8  percent year over \\nyear in March . This metric has been slowing consistently since the September 2022 reading of 5.5 \\npercent, but the pace of decreases has slowed in 2024.  The 3-month average (annualized) rate spiked \\nto 4.4 percent in March after reaching 1.6 percent in December 2023. The pace of monthly core PCE \\ninflation previously registered at or below the 2.0 percent annual pace in five of the six months from July \\nto December 2023, but it spiked to 6.2 percent in January. This resurgence of inflation provides support \\nfor the Fed to hold off on cuts for now. Core non-housing services (roughly a 50-percent slice of private \\nconsumption) was one of the final  sectors to \\nexperience disinflation, but as shown on chart \\n13 it was a significant driver of the recent spike.  \\nThe Fed\\'s statutory dual mandate \\nrequires a balanced approach to promoting \\nmaximum employment alongside price \\nstability. The labor market has held up nicely \\nso far in 2024. The average monthly pace of \\n246,000 job gains so far this year is a slight'),\n",

The resilience in the labor market gives the Fed a longer runway to ensure above-target inflation \\nis extinguished prior to pivoting toward lower rates. \\nThe economic costs of reining in inflation would likely be much larger if high inflation were to \\nbecome engrained in long-term plans and contracts. The 5-year -to-10-year inflation expectations \\nmeasure from the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers ticked up to 3.1 percent in May, near \\nthe top of its recent range. However, most measures of inflation expectations have remained reasonably \\nwell-anchored in 2024. \\nThe Fed has been reducing the size of its balance sheet since May 2022. At that time, the Fed \\nannounced a 95 billion dollar per month redemption cap for its securities holdings, and it has been \\nshrinking its balance sheet by around 80 billion dollars per month since then. On May 1st of this year, the \\nFed announced that it would slow the pace of decline by establishing a new redemption cap of 60 billion \\ndollars per month, although the actual amount rolled off will likely be 40‚Äì45 billion dollars per month. \\nWe believe that our forecast is consistent with a Fed that will be  content to hold rates steady \\nbefore cutting slowly . We project the Fed to start cutting rates in the second half of 2024, with the \\nSeptember FOMC looking like the most likely date for the first cut as of this writing. By that time, we \\nexpect unemployment to edge up further and the annualized pace of core PCE inflation to dip below 3.0 \\npercent, down from 3.7 percent in 2024Q1. With the fed funds rate still around 5.3 percent, the implied \\nshort-term real interest rate near 2.5 percent will likely appear somewhat restrictive given the softening \\nlabor market and normalizing inflation. We \\nexpect the Fed to cut rates slowly, however, \\nwith only one cut in 2024 and three in 2025. \\nChart 14 shows our projections for \\nselected key interest rates. The 3-month \\nTreasury bill rate declines from 5.2 percent in \\n2024Q2 to 4.9  percent in 2024Q4 and 4.3 \\npercent in 2025Q4. The 10-year Treasury rate\"),\n",

The yield curve flattens  at long last by the end of 2025. Mortgage rates \\ndecline more quickly than longer-term government bond yields as the excess spread that has developed \\nbetween them shrinks toward more normal levels  in light of the decline in medium -run policy rate \\nuncertainty. The 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgage rate rises to 7.0 percent in 2024Q 2 before \\ndeclining to 6.6 percent in 2024Q4 and 6.0 percent by 2025Q4. \\nFiscal Policy \\nThe suspense surrounding a potential federal government shutdown has dissipated for a few \\nmonths, as Congress reached an agreement on the full-year funding package for fiscal year 2024 by the \\nend of March. The FY2024 appropriations bills have set the topli ne spending total at 1.6 trillion dollars, \\nwith an increase of 26.8 billion dollars in defense spending (from 798 to 825 billion dollars) and a \\nmoderate decline of 61.0 billion dollars in non-defense spending (from 827 to 766 billion dollars) \\ncompared to FY2023. We expect this cut to non-defense spending authorizations to take a while to filter \\ninto actual outlays. \\nDespite this long-overdue achievement, theatrics persist, as Congress just dodged another \\nmotion to vacate the House speakership following the passage of foreign aid bills in late April. Based on \\nCBO's estimates, we project that this spending, totaling 95.3 billion dollars, will temporarily increase \\ndefense consumption expenditure and investment further until the end of FY2026. This passage \\nconcluded months of heated discussions in Congress, with Republicans seemingly walking out empty -\\nhanded on the border security bills that had been under the spotlight. Although it remains unclear what \\nconcessions House Democrats may have offered in return aside from defending the speakership, we \\njudge that additional meaningful fiscal actions are unlikely to occur at least until after the elections.   \\nThe Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act, which passed in the House with an \\nunusually large margin of 357‚Äì50 in January, has stalled in the Senate. The current bill couples increases \\nin refundable child tax credits with an extension of tax breaks from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 \\n(TCJA), which are set to expire by the end of 2025.

Moreover, the \\nappetite for bipartisan dealmaking is fading as elections approach. Therefore, we believe the bill\\'s chance \\nof passing the Senate in its present form is quite slim.  \\nThe 118th Congress still needs to develop and pass a new budget for fiscal 2025 within the next \\nfive months. Unfortunately, it is already off to a rocky start. The president\\'s budget for FY2025, released \\nin March and proposed an increase of 11 billion dollars in total discretionary spending, largely in line with \\nthe Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. The budget proposal  has already faced a backlash from \\nRepublicans because of high levels of spending in fiscal 2026 and beyond. The concurrent budget \\nresolution proposed by the House Budget Committee, on the other hand, contained several deep cuts to \\ngovernment programs and agencies such as Obamacare and the Internal Revenue Service starting in \\nfiscal 2026. We anticipate more contentious fights going forward, with  a timely resolution seem ingly \\nunlikely.  \\nWe continue to believe that a divided government is the most likely outcome of the 2024 elections, \\nwhich suggests that enacting substantial revenue-raising or expenditure-cutting reforms will require \\ncompromise. Our forecast features the likely path of least resistance: a slowdown in discretionary \\nnondefense spending growth alongside steady growth in defense spending.  \\nTable 1 shows the data and our projections for the federal budget on a National Income and \\nProduct Accounts basis (NIPA) from fiscal \\nyears 2022 to 2025, broken down by receipts \\nand major expenditure categories. Federal tax \\nrevenue jumped by more than 200 billion \\ndollars in 2024Q1, boosted in part by \\n\"declarations and settlements\" revenue, which \\ngrew more than 100 billion dollars. That jump \\nwas likely due to the rebound of capital gains \\nduring 2023, as major stock indices  gained \\nrapidly. As a result, federal receipts are set to grow at a brisk pace of 6.4 percent in fiscal 2024. Receipt'),\n",

Robust defense spending growth fuels the \\nmomentum in overall federal consumption. Transfer payments are expected to expand by 1.0 percent in \\nfiscal 2024, and then by a further  2.4 percent in fiscal 2025 due to an increase in transfer payment to \\npersons. On the other hand, federal subsidies continue shrinking toward their pre-pandemic levels \\nthrough fiscal 2024‚Äì25.  \\nInterest payments on the federal debt, however, rose by over one-third in fiscal  2023 due to \\nsharply higher interest rates. In fact, they have exceeded defense consumption expenditures and gross \\ninvestment combined since 2023Q4. We expect this state of affairs, which previously occurred only once \\nin 1998 for a single quarter, to persist throughout our forecast window. The growth of interest payments \\nwill decelerate to 19.7 percent in fiscal 2024 and 11.2 percent in fiscal 2025, but it remains brisk.  \\nWe anticipate the federal deficit to ease slightly as a share of nominal GDP in fiscal  2024 and \\n2025 thanks to the jump in personal tax revenues . The decline will be welcome following its increase \\nfrom 4.4 percent to 5.8 percent as a share of GDP over the past two fiscal years. The privately held debt-\\nto-GDP ratio is poised to increase from  80.9 percent in 2024Q1 to 84.6 percent in 2025Q4, as sizeable  \\ndeficits continue, and the Fed tapers the pace of its sales of Treasury security holdings starting from June \\n2024. \\nThe Housing Market \\nMortgage rates have been back on the rise this year, revers ing some of the affordability gains \\nfrom late last year. The 30-year conventional fixed rate mortgage rate, as reported weekly by Freddie \\nMac, has climbed to 7.1 percent from 6.6 percent at the beginning of the year.

M ovements in house p rices tend not to fully offset the \\nimpact of changes in mortgages rates on monthly mortgage payments . We therefore expect the recent \\nincrease in rates to translate to at least some setback in affordability. \\nMore timely indicators of activity in the housing market are sending mixed signals following the \\nincrease in mortgage rates. The Mortgage Bankers Association's index of loan applications for purchases \\nhas come up from its lowest reading in almost 30 years in October 2023, but it remains at a deeply \\ndepressed level. The University of Michigan Survey of Consumers ' sentiment indices of conditions for \\nbuying and selling a home have both mostly improved so far in 2024, although they remain much lower \\nthan before the run-up in mortgage rates. Existing single-family home sales have perked up in 2024 to a \\n3.8 million annual sales pace in March, albeit from a very slow pace at the end of last year. The seasonally \\nadjusted months' supply of single-family existing homes has averaged 3.3 months in January ‚ÄìMarch \\nafter rising to 3.6 months in December 2023. While there has been a measurable improvement in the \\nnumber of active for -sale listings, we believe that high mortgage rates continue to lock many potential \\nsellers into the low -rate mortgages they secured in the past. A return to falling mortgage rates should \\nhelp to unlock inventory and allow for the return of healthier activity in the market for existing homes. \\nChart 15 plots our preferred measure of affordability, our calculation of the ratio between a \\nmortgage payment on a newly bought home and the average wage income per worker. We estimate that \\nthis ratio climbed to 47.2 percent in the fourth \\nquarter of 2023, the highest since 1990, \\nbefore declining to 44.5 in the first quarter of \\n2024.

Credit card and auto loan delinquencies have been rising for months, growth of revolving \\nconsumer credit appears to be slowing, and sales of new light vehicles seem to be flatlining. Should these \\ntrends continue, the consumption and labor market outlooks could deteriorate significantly. \\nInflation re-accelerated in the first three months of the year and has only eased marginally in April, \\nbut we are expecting it to moderate by the end of 2024. Inflation is notoriously hard to forecast, however, \\nso both upside and downside surprises are quite possible. We would expect any material deviation in \\ninflation from our forecast path to propagate through to monetary policy, interest rates, consumption and \\ninvestment, and labor market outcomes. While we continue to expect rental inflation to moderate, \\nabysmal affordability in the home purchase market may result in some upward pressure on rents, making \\nit more difficult for overall inflation to decline all the way toward the Fed's target. \\nOur outlook for the labor market features a gradual cooldown in growth this year, followed by \\nmoderate but stable job growth in 2025. Yet the demand for labor could cool substantially more quickly \\nthan we have forecast, with rates of unemployment overshooting our medium -run projections. On the \\nother hand, the recent pace of job gains  has likely been boosted by the inflow of fresh immigrants into \\nthe country. These additional workers may have alleviated some supply constraints by filling vacancies \\nthat would not have been filled otherwise and, possibly, restrained wage growth in some industries. Even \\nif the immigration wave stops, the projected increase in labor force participation among the recent \\nimmigrants as they settle in may outpace that of previous immigration waves, relaxing labor supply \\nconstraints by more than we expect.  \\nIn the face of noisy data, FOMC members could end up misreading the state of the economy and \\nalso the effective degree of current policy tightening, which depends on estimates of the neutral policy \\nrate. Estimates of neutral policy rates are inherently noisy, and even more so in the current environment, \\nwhich is fraught with many global economic and political changes. A 2.5 percent neutral rate implies \\nalmost double the degree of policy restriction compared to a 4.0 percent neutral rate.

Ongoing \\ninflation, however, will still provide some support to nominal revenues in fiscal 2023‚Äì24, making sure that \\nfederal revenues keep edging up despite the economic slowdown we project. A product of modest \\nrevenue growth and rising interest expenses, the federal deficit widens to an average of 5.7 percent of \\nGDP in fiscal 2023‚Äì 24. These wide deficits will push the privately held debt-to-GDP ratio higher. W e \\nproject this ratio to increase from about 73.2 percent in 2023Q1 to nearly 80.6 percent in 2024Q4.'),\n",

Based on an internal \\nnowcasting model, w e have penciled in a slight temporary inc rease of 0.2 percent for national house \\nprices in the first quarter of 2023 (compared to \\nthe 0.9 percent decline recorded in the fourth \\nquarter). We project that prices will fall \\nmodestly in the second and third quarter s. \\nAfter that, a slowdown in overall economic \\nconditions will hold prices from appreciating \\nmeaningfully until the second half of next year. \\nIn year -over-year terms , we are forecasting \\nthe Case-Shiller Home Price  Index to fall by \\n2.6 percent in 2023Q2 and to hold flat in nominal terms from 2022Q4 to 2023Q4. The Index grows by \\nonly 0.7 percent year-over-year in 2024Q4. \\nEnergy Markets \\nEnergy markets have continued to oscillate, albeit with prices markedly down from the highs of  \\n2022. The price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) averaged 76 dollars per barrel in 2023Q1, \\nsignificantly lower than the 2022 average of 95 dollars per barrel. The U.S. benchmark oil price has spent \\nmost of 2023 in the 70‚Äì80 dollars per barrel range. \\nOil-exporting countries have attempted to sustain higher prices  with announced production cuts. \\nIn February, Russia declared it would reduce crude oil production by 0.5 million barrels per  day (bpd), \\nroughly 5 percent of its total output. In early April, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and \\nits allies (OPEC+) announced further production cuts of 1.4 million bpd. The International Energy Agency \\n(IEA) expects production from non-OPEC+ countries to grow by 1 million bpd in response, partially but \\nnot fully offsetting the announced cuts.')]"
